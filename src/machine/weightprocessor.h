// Runs on a dedicated worker thread. Receives weight samples from the scale,
// computes LSLR flow rates, and makes SAW/per-frame-exit decisions
// independently of main thread congestion.
//
// Input (via QueuedConnection from main thread):
//   - processWeight(): called at ~5Hz with each scale reading
//   - configure(): called once at shot start with targets and learning data
//   - setCurrentFrame(): called at ~5Hz from DE1 shot samples
//
// Output (via QueuedConnection back to main thread):
//   - stopNow(): triggers DE1Device::stopOperationUrgent()
//   - sawTriggered(): carries context for SAW learning
//   - skipFrame(): triggers DE1Device::skipToNextFrame()
//   - flowRatesReady(): feeds ShotTimingController for graph/settling
