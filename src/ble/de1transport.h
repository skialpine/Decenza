/**
 * Abstract transport interface for DE1 communication.
 *
 * This abstraction allows DE1Device to communicate over different transports:
 * - BleTransport: Uses QLowEnergyController (BLE over Bluetooth)
 * - SerialTransport: Uses QSerialPort (USB-C wired connection)
 *
 * Both transports use QBluetoothUuid to identify characteristics. BLE uses
 * them natively; SerialTransport maps them to single-letter codes internally.
 *
 * Data payloads are QByteArray in both cases - the binary protocol is identical
 * regardless of physical transport.
