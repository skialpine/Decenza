// BatteryManager — controls the DE1's USB charge port to protect the tablet battery.
//
// Hardware setup
// ──────────────
// The tablet (which runs this app) charges through a USB cable plugged into the DE1
// espresso machine. The DE1 has a hardware-controlled USB charge port that can be
// switched on or off via a BLE MMR write (address 0x803854, 1=on, 0=off). This class
// decides when to enable or disable that port based on the tablet's battery level.
//
// The DE1 has a built-in 10-minute safety timeout that automatically re-enables its
// USB port if it hasn't received a command. We resend our decision every 60 seconds
// to stay in control.
//
// Smart charging modes
// ────────────────────
// Off   — DE1 USB port always on. Battery charges freely to 100%.
// On    — Cycles between 55 % and 65 %. Port turns off at 65 %, back on at 55 %.
//         Extends long-term battery lifespan by avoiding constant top-up charging.
// Night — Cycles between 90 % and 95 %. Keeps battery high for morning use while
//         still avoiding 100 % stress.
//
// Mismatch detection
// ──────────────────
// On Android and iOS we read the actual charging status from the OS (independent of
// what we commanded). If we have told the DE1 to enable its USB port but the OS reports
// the tablet is still DISCHARGING, that means the DE1's port isn't delivering power —
// likely because the DE1 went to sleep and cut the port, or a BLE write silently failed.
// We retry the BLE command immediately but wait for 5 consecutive failed 60-second
// checks (~5 min) before alerting the user, since the DE1 can temporarily cut USB
// power for its own hardware needs (e.g. during preheating).
//
// Note: on iOS, UIDevice.batteryState can report Charging/Full/Unplugged but cannot
// distinguish the DE1 USB port from a wall charger. If the tablet is on wall power,
// mismatch detection will see "CHARGING" even when the DE1 port is off — it won't
// produce false alerts, but it also can't detect "wrong power source".
