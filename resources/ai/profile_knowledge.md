# Profile Knowledge Base — AI Reference

When analyzing a shot, use this section to understand what the profile was DESIGNED to do.
Do NOT flag intentional profile behaviors as problems.

## D-Flow / default
Also matches: "D-Flow / Q", "D-Flow / La Pavoni", "Damian's Q", "Damian's LRv2", "Damian's LRv3", "Damian's LM Leva", "Damian's D-Flow"
Category: Lever/Flow hybrid (Londinium family)
How it works: All D-Flow variants and Damian's profiles share the same core: pressurized pre-infusion with soak, then flow-controlled pour (default 1.7 ml/s). Pressure peaks then gradually declines — this is intentional lever-style behavior. Can heal uneven puck prep.
Variants: "D-Flow / default" is the starter profile. "D-Flow / Q" (also "Damian's Q") is optimized for medium-light beans. "D-Flow / La Pavoni" emulates a La Pavoni lever. "Damian's LM Leva" emulates a La Marzocco Leva — more creamy than chocolatey body.
Expected curves: Pressure peaks between 6 and 9 bar early, then declines as puck erodes. Flow stays near target (1.7-2.7 ml/s). Declining pressure is NORMAL and INTENTIONAL.
Damian's LRv2: If the puck erodes too fast during extraction, switches from pressure to flow control at 1.7 ml/s. This may cause a pressure drop — intentional puck-erosion recovery.
Damian's LRv3: Pure lever decline — does NOT switch to flow control. Simpler and preferred when dialed in well.
Temperature: The low fill temperature (e.g. 84°C) is INTENTIONAL and controls bitterness — hotter fill water produces dark spots in the crema and more bitter taste. After filling, the target rises to 94°C, but the coffee never reaches 94°C — the high setpoint just makes the heater pump hot water that mixes with the cooler water above the puck, gradually reaching ~88°C at the basket. This is a KEY aspect of D-Flow. DO NOT flag the large gap between temperature target (94°C) and actual (~86-88°C) as a problem — it is by design.
Flow calibration: If actual flow is consistently below target (e.g. 1.8 target but only 1.5 actual), the flow sensor may be over-reading by ~20%. Reducing the calibration value will show more pressure for the same grind.
Grind: Medium-fine. Grind determines curve shape: finer grinds produce constant-pressure extraction (boiler-like), coarser grinds produce declining pressure (lever-like). Both are valid — the pressure curve shape is a function of grind, not a problem.
Roast: All roasts. Excellent for medium (floral/fruity + chocolate). Good for light and dark.
DO NOT flag declining pressure as a problem — it defines this entire profile family.

## A-Flow
Category: Pressure-ramp into flow extraction
How it works: An alternative to D-Flow. Fill and optional infuse/soak, then pressure ramps UP to target (typically 9-10 bar), followed by optional pressure decline, then switches to flow-controlled extraction with a pressure limiter. The key difference from D-Flow: pressure intentionally RISES before extraction rather than starting high and declining.
Variants: "A-Flow / medium" is the default starter. "A-Flow / dark" optimized for dark roasts. "A-Flow / very dark" uses ramp-down for darkest beans. "A-Flow / like D-Flow" has a long 60s infuse and resembles D-Flow behavior.
Expected curves: Pressure ramps up to 9-10 bar during the ramp phase, may decline briefly, then flow takes over for extraction. Flow during extraction is typically ~2 ml/s with pressure capped by the limiter. The pressure ramp-up is INTENTIONAL — this is not overpressure.
Options: rampDownEnabled splits the ramp time between pressure-up and pressure-decline phases. flowExtractionUp ramps extraction flow smoothly upward (vs flat). secondFillEnabled adds an extra water fill before the pressure ramp.
Grind: Similar to D-Flow — medium-fine
Roast: All roasts. Variants optimized for medium through very dark.
DO NOT flag the pressure ramp-up phase as overpressure — the intentional rise to 9-10 bar before flow extraction is how this profile works.

## Adaptive v2
Category: Flow/adaptive
How it works: Rises pressure to 8.6 bar for ~7 seconds, then adapts to grind coarseness by locking in whatever flow rate exists. Switches to stable flow after pressure peak.
Expected curves: Pressure peaks near 9 bar then gradually declines. Flow settles at 2.0-2.7 ml/s. Variable curves are expected — the profile adapts to grind size.
Duration: 26-40s. With large flat burrs, extraction phase may be very short (explosive extraction after long pre-infusion soak).
Pre-infusion: Lots of dripping is fine with flat burr grinders (up to 17g dripping worked well in testing). Pressure drops steeply during drip phase with coarse/flat-burr grinds — this is normal.
Ratio: Best at 1:1.8-2.3 for light roasts (fruitiness). Can extend to 1:2.5 if no off-flavors.
Roast: Good for light (v2 updated for light roasts). Excellent for medium-light. Not recommended for dark.
DO NOT flag variable pressure curves or steep pre-infusion pressure drop as problems.

## Blooming Espresso
Category: Blooming
How it works: Fill at ~7-8 ml/s until pressure peaks, close valve for 30s bloom, then open to desired pressure. The 30-second pause with zero flow is INTENTIONAL.
Expected curves: Initial pressure spike during fill, then 30s of declining/zero pressure (bloom phase), then pressure rise to 6-9 bar for extraction. Flow near zero during bloom is BY DESIGN.
Dialing in: Water should appear on bottom of puck almost immediately after fill. Aim for 6-8g dripping before pressure rise. Pressure during extraction should be 6-9 bar and NEVER hit maximum. If pressure hits max, grind is too fine.
Grind: Very fine — grind as fine as manageable. Paper filter under puck can prevent pressure crash.
Duration: ~70s total
Extraction: 23-26% typical (highest of any espresso profile)
Ratio: Up to 1:3
Roast: Excellent for light (hardest to dial in but most rewarding). Good for medium. Not ideal for dark.
This is the hardest profile to dial in — requires lots of beans to experiment. DO NOT flag the 30s bloom pause as a problem.

## Blooming Allonge
Also matches: "Blooming Allongé"
Category: Blooming/Allonge hybrid
How it works: Fill until pressure peaks, close valve for bloom until pressure returns to ~1 bar (typically 4-10g in cup), then high-flow percolation at ~4.5 ml/s.
Expected curves: Pressure spike, bloom decay to ~1 bar, then low pressure (<6 bar) during percolation.
Grind: Ultra-fine or Turkish
Pressure: Should not exceed 6 bar during percolation
Flavor: Filter-like texture, high clarity
Roast: Best for ultra-light, Nordic filter roasts.
DO NOT flag zero flow during bloom or low pressure during percolation as problems.

## Allonge
Also matches: "Allongé", "Rao Allongé"
Category: Allonge
How it works: Constant high flow at 4.5 ml/s with low pressure (~4-6 bar). Coarsest grind of all espresso profiles.
Expected curves: Flow at 4.5 ml/s, pressure 4-6 bar. Some channeling (visible as a needle stream) is NORMAL and expected at this flow rate.
Duration: ~30s
Ratio: 1:4-1:5 (high ratio is intentional)
Grind: Coarsest of espresso profiles
Temperature: High — produces hottest coffee of any profile due to fast flow (puck doesn't cool water)
Roast: Best for ultralight/light. Excellent with natural/fermented/fruity beans. Less impressive with clean washed coffees.
DO NOT flag high ratio, low pressure, or minor channeling as problems — all are expected.

## Default
Category: Lever
How it works: Classic lever-style declining pressure, 8.6 to 6 bar. Fast fill, immediate pressure rise, then decline.
Expected curves: Pressure peaks at 8.6 bar and declines to ~6 bar. Flow stays relatively constant as declining pressure compensates for puck erosion.
Grind: Versatile — mimics 8.5 bar for fine grinds, Londinium for optimal grinds, limits flow for coarse grinds.
Flavor: Emphasizes chocolate intensity
Roast: Excellent for medium, good for dark. Not recommended for light.

## Londinium / LRv3
Also matches: "Londonium"
Category: Lever
How it works: Fast fill, then spring-lever soak at ~3 bar until dripping appears, then 9 bar declining pressure. LRv2 switches to flow (1.7 ml/s) if puck erodes too fast; LRv3 is pure lever decline.
Expected curves: 3 bar hold during soak (dripping phase), then 9 bar peak with gradual decline. Pressure stays high (9→8 bar) because flow is held constant. Flow relatively constant throughout.
Temperature: 88°C
Grind: Fine (same as Cremina, finer than E61/80s)
Extraction: Highest of dark roast profiles — most full-bodied cup
Flavor: Dark chocolate, smooth. Rich and bold.
Roast: Excellent for dark (full body without harshness). Good for medium-dark. Struggles with light.
DO NOT flag the 3 bar soak phase as "low pressure" — it's intentional pre-infusion.

## Turbo Shot
Category: Flow/Pressure hybrid
How it works: Full pump output (~7-8 ml/s), reduce to maintain ~6 bar. Very short extraction.
Expected curves: Fast pressure rise to ~6 bar, high flow. Shot finishes quickly.
Duration: 10-20s (speed is intentional)
Dose: 15-17g (smaller than traditional)
Ratio: 1:2-1:3
Temperature: 92-95°C
Grind: Medium-fine (coarser than typical espresso, fine enough to spike to 6 bar)
Roast: All coffee types
DO NOT flag short shot time or high flow as problems — speed is the point.

## Filter 2.0 / 2.1
Category: Filter (Blooming variant)
How it works: Bloom phase then flow-controlled extraction at 3 ml/s with <3 bar pressure.
Temperature: 90°C preinfusion, 85°C percolation
Dose: 20-22g in 24g basket
Ratio: 5:1 extraction, then dilute with 225-250g water
Flow: 3 ml/s (essential)
Pressure limit: 3 bar safeguard
Grind: Finer than filter, not quite espresso
Setup: Two micron 55mm paper filters in bottom, metal mesh on top
Extraction yield: 23-26% at 1.4-1.5% strength
Roast: Lower temperature for darker or defective roasts
DO NOT flag low pressure or high ratio as problems.

## Sprover
Category: Filter simulation
How it works: Under-dose basket (e.g. 15g in 20g basket), coarse grind, low pressure.
Dose: Under-basket
Grind: Coarser than allonge
Flow: 1.5-4.5 ml/s
Pressure: Keep below 1.5 bar during fill
Ratio: 1:10-1:14 (ultra-high, intentional)
Duration: ~100s
Starting point: 15g:195g, 2 ml/s, ~100s
DO NOT flag ultra-high ratio or ultra-low pressure as problems — this is filter simulation.

## Gentle & Sweet
Also matches: "Gentle and sweet"
Category: Pressure
How it works: 6 bar constant pressure, no pre-infusion. Water fills headspace and immediately goes to pressure. As puck erodes, flow increases from ~2 ml/s to 3+ ml/s.
Expected curves: Flat 6 bar pressure. Flow starts ~2 ml/s and increases steadily as puck erodes. This increasing flow is NORMAL for constant pressure profiles.
Duration: Fast shot expected (~25s). Not a long shot.
Grind: Does not need as fine a grind as Blooming or Adaptive. Good for beginner grinders.
Extraction: ~18-19% (lowest of light roast profiles)
Roast: Good beginner-friendly entry for light roasts. Lower pressure means less channeling risk.
DO NOT flag increasing flow rate as a problem — it's the natural result of constant pressure with puck erosion.

## Extractamundo Dos
Category: Pressure
How it works: Like Gentle & Sweet but with a short pre-infusion pause. Fill, brief pause (water soaks puck), then rise to 6 bar.
Expected curves: Similar to G&S — 6 bar target pressure, flow increasing over time. May not quite reach 6 bar with same grind as G&S (pre-infusion reduces puck resistance).
Grind: Slightly finer than G&S if you want to reach same pressure
Extraction: Slightly more than G&S due to pre-infusion
Flavor: More acidic/sharp, fruitier, juicier than G&S. More concentrated.
Roast: Good for light. Community favorite for consistent light roast espresso. Good for beans with slight off-flavors.

## Flow Profile
Category: Flow
How it works: Maintains constant flow rate of 1.7 ml/s throughout extraction. Pressure adapts to puck resistance.
Expected curves: Flat flow at 1.7 ml/s. Pressure varies based on grind and puck condition — this is normal for flow-controlled profiles.
Flavor: Fruitier, more nuanced than Default. More complex flavor development.
Roast: Good for medium. Good for milky drinks.
DO NOT flag varying pressure as a problem — the machine controls flow, not pressure.

## Cremina lever machine
Also matches: "Cremina"
Category: Lever
How it works: Lever machine emulation. Fast fill, brief soak, then steep pressure decline. Flow rate drops as shot progresses (opposite of constant-pressure profiles). Produces maximum mouthfeel.
Expected curves: Pressure peaks at 9 bar then STEEPLY declines (much more than Londinium). Flow starts moderate and DECREASES. This declining flow is the key feature — it keeps coffee concentrated as puck erodes.
Temperature: 92°C
Duration: ~45s (longer than other lever profiles)
Grind: Fine (same as Londinium)
Flavor: Maximum mouthfeel, thick syrupy espresso. Baker's chocolate, intense. Very thick crema. "King of chocolate."
Roast: Excellent for dark. Highest temperature of dark profiles = most extraction = most intense.
DO NOT flag steeply declining pressure or declining flow as problems — this IS the Cremina style.

## 80's Espresso
Category: Lever at low temperature
How it works: Lever profile at very low temperature (80→70°C declining). No pre-infusion — maximum water flow fills puck immediately. Intentionally under-extracts to minimize tar/burnt flavors from dark beans.
Expected curves: Lever-style declining pressure. Temperature starts at 80°C and declines toward 70°C. Flow should be SLOW (ideally 1-1.2 ml/s for best results). If flow peaks at 1.9+ ml/s, shot will be dusty/thin — slower is better.
Duration: 35-45s is ideal (lever-style timing). 25s is too short.
Grind: Medium (coarser than Londinium/Cremina, finer than E61)
Flavor: Bread fruit, raisins, baker's chocolate without burn. Minimizes tar flavors.
Best with 12g waisted basket for maximum mouthfeel and minimal channeling. 1:1 ratio (Italian style) also works well.
Roast: Dark only. Designed specifically to get fruitiness from dark beans by using low temperature.
DO NOT flag low temperature as a problem — it's the entire point of this profile.

## Best Overall
Category: Lever (simple 3-step)
How it works: Three-step: fast fill → 8.6 bar peak → declining pressure to ~6 bar. No long soak time (unlike Londinium). Traditional pressure-controlled shot.
Expected curves: Fast fill in ~5s, pressure rises to 8.6 bar, then gradually declines. Flow stays relatively constant as declining pressure compensates for puck erosion.
Temperature: 88°C
Grind: Can use same fine grind as Londinium/Cremina for a longer ~45s shot, or coarser for faster shot.
Flavor: Less extracted than Londinium/Cremina. Smooth, easy drinker. Not much acidity. Less crema than Cremina.
Best for: Milk drinks (flat whites, lattes). From Scott Rao's espresso book appendix.
Roast: Good for dark. Good for medium.

## E61
Category: Flat pressure
How it works: Flat 9 bar constant pressure. No pre-infusion, no declining pressure. Flow INCREASES as puck erodes — this is the characteristic E61 behavior.
Expected curves: 9 bar constant pressure throughout. Flow starts moderate and increases steadily. This increasing flow causes characteristic sourness/acidity in longer shots.
Duration: 22-25s (shorter than lever profiles). Longer shots get increasingly sour due to rising flow.
Grind: Coarsest of all dark roast profiles (coarser than 80s, which is coarser than Londinium/Cremina)
Temperature: 92°C (but historically very variable on real E61 machines)
Flavor: Some balanced acidity (which can be pleasant). Baker's chocolate. Less smooth than lever profiles.
Roast: Good for dark (balanced acidity). Can be edited via 3-step editor to add pre-infusion or declining pressure.
Adjustable: Use the 3-step editor to add pre-infusion (line pressure soak) or declining pressure (4-6 bar end point gives pleasing acidity balance). Dropping pressure too quickly makes shot boring/muted.
DO NOT flag increasing flow as a problem — it's characteristic of flat 9 bar profiles.
