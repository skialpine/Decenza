# shot-save-filter Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-discard-aborted-shots. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: The application SHALL classify and discard espresso shots that did not start

When an espresso extraction ends and reaches the save path, the application SHALL classify the shot as *aborted* iff BOTH of the following hold: `extractionDuration < 10.0 s` AND `finalWeight < 5.0 g`. The two clauses form a conjunction; either alone is insufficient to classify the shot as aborted. Long-running low-yield shots (e.g. a choked puck producing 1 g over 60 s) MUST NOT classify as aborted, because their graphs are diagnostically valuable.

When the `Settings.brew.discardAbortedShots` toggle is `true` (default) AND the classifier returns *aborted*, the application SHALL skip persisting the shot to `ShotHistoryStorage` AND SHALL skip any visualizer auto-upload for that shot. When the toggle is `false`, the classifier SHALL NOT be consulted and all shots SHALL save as they do today.

The classification SHALL apply only to shots that flow through the espresso save path (`MainController::endShot()` with `m_extractionStarted == true`). Steam, hot water, flush, and cleaning operations are out of scope and SHALL not be evaluated against this classifier.

The two threshold values (`10.0 s`, `5.0 g`) SHALL be hard-coded constants in the C++ source. They SHALL NOT be exposed as user-tunable settings; the only user-facing control is the boolean discard toggle.

#### Scenario: Canonical preinfusion abort is discarded

- **GIVEN** the discard toggle is enabled
- **AND** an espresso shot ends with `extractionDuration = 2.3 s` and `finalWeight = 1.1 g`
- **WHEN** `endShot()` reaches the save path
- **THEN** the classifier SHALL return *aborted*
- **AND** `ShotHistoryStorage::saveShot()` SHALL NOT be called for this shot
- **AND** any visualizer auto-upload SHALL NOT run for this shot
- **AND** the application SHALL emit a UI signal that a discard occurred

#### Scenario: Long, low-yield choke is preserved

- **GIVEN** the discard toggle is enabled
- **AND** an espresso shot ends with `extractionDuration = 59.6 s` and `finalWeight = 1.1 g`
- **WHEN** `endShot()` reaches the save path
- **THEN** the classifier SHALL return *kept* (duration ≥ 10 s)
- **AND** the shot SHALL be saved normally to history

#### Scenario: Short shot with real yield is preserved

- **GIVEN** the discard toggle is enabled
- **AND** an espresso shot ends with `extractionDuration = 7.3 s` and `finalWeight = 37.4 g` (turbo-style)
- **WHEN** `endShot()` reaches the save path
- **THEN** the classifier SHALL return *kept* (yield ≥ 5 g)
- **AND** the shot SHALL be saved normally to history

#### Scenario: Toggle off bypasses the classifier entirely

- **GIVEN** the discard toggle is disabled (`Settings.brew.discardAbortedShots == false`)
- **AND** an espresso shot ends with `extractionDuration = 2.3 s` and `finalWeight = 1.1 g`
- **WHEN** `endShot()` reaches the save path
- **THEN** the classifier SHALL NOT be evaluated
- **AND** the shot SHALL be saved normally to history

#### Scenario: Boundary — exactly at threshold is preserved

- **GIVEN** the discard toggle is enabled
- **AND** an espresso shot ends with `extractionDuration = 10.0 s` and `finalWeight = 4.9 g`
- **WHEN** `endShot()` reaches the save path
- **THEN** the classifier SHALL return *kept* because the duration clause uses strict `<` (not `<=`)
- **AND** the shot SHALL be saved normally to history

#### Scenario: Non-espresso paths are not classified

- **GIVEN** a steam, hot water, or flush operation completes
- **WHEN** the operation's end-of-cycle handler runs
- **THEN** the aborted-shot classifier SHALL NOT be invoked
- **AND** the operation's existing save behavior (or absence of save) SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: Every classifier evaluation is logged

- **GIVEN** the discard toggle is enabled
- **WHEN** an espresso shot ends and the classifier runs
- **THEN** the application SHALL log a single line via the async logger containing: `extractionDuration` (seconds, 3 decimal places), `finalWeight` (grams, 1 decimal place), the verdict (`aborted` or `kept`), and the action (`discarded` or `saved`)

---

### Requirement: The application SHALL surface a notification toast whenever a shot is discarded

When the classifier discards a shot, the application SHALL display a notification toast with the translated message `"Shot did not start — not recorded"`. The toast is informational only — there is no recovery path; a discarded shot is intentionally not recorded. The toast SHALL auto-dismiss after a fixed timeout (timer is permitted here per the project's UI auto-dismiss carve-out).

#### Scenario: Toast appears when a shot is discarded

- **GIVEN** an aborted shot is discarded by the classifier
- **WHEN** the discard signal fires
- **THEN** a toast SHALL appear on the current top page of the QML stack
- **AND** the toast text SHALL be the translated equivalent of `"Shot did not start — not recorded"`
- **AND** the toast SHALL auto-dismiss after a few seconds with no user action required
