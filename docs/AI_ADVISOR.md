|------|---------|
| `src/ai/aimanager.h/cpp` | Central coordinator: provider management, conversation routing (max 5, keyed by bean+profile), shot analysis, email fallback |
| `src/ai/aiprovider.h/cpp` | Abstract base + 5 provider implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama) |
| `src/ai/aiconversation.h/cpp` | Multi-turn conversation with persistent storage (QSettings). Follow-ups, shot context injection, history trimming |
| `src/ai/shotsummarizer.h/cpp` | Extracts structured shot data (phases, curves, anomalies) and builds text prompts. Separate system prompts for espresso vs filter |

### Providers

| Provider | Model | Caching | Cost |
|----------|-------|---------|------|
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Explicit `cache_control` on system prompt. 5-min TTL, ~90% discount on cached input | Cloud |

| Ollama | User-selected | N/A — local, no cost | Local/free |

### What the AI Receives Today

**System prompt** (~3-4K tokens base + ~150-300 tokens per-profile section): Espresso or filter-specific guidance covering DE1 machine behavior, pressure/flow interpretation, common shot patterns, roast considerations, grinder/burr geometry, and response guidelines. When the shot's profile matches a curated entry in the profile knowledge base (`resources/ai/profile_knowledge.md`), a profile-specific section is appended describing expected curve behavior, intentional design choices, and what NOT to flag as problems.

**Per-shot user prompt** (~1-2K tokens):
- Profile name, author, type, intent (notes)
- Profile recipe (frame-by-frame description)
- Dose, yield, ratio, duration
- Phase breakdown with actual vs target values at start/peak-deviation/end
- Coffee metadata (bean brand, type, roast level, roast date) — **only if user enters it manually**
- Grinder model and setting — **only if user enters it manually**
- TDS/EY — **only if user enters it manually**
- Tasting notes and enjoyment score — **only if user enters it manually**
- Anomaly flags (channeling, temperature instability)

**Dial-in history** (~200-500 tokens per historical shot, up to 5): When the current shot has a `knowledge_base_id`, the system queries the last 5 shots with the same KB ID from `ShotHistoryStorage::getRecentShotsByKbId()`. Each historical shot includes: profile name, recipe (frame-by-frame), dose/yield/ratio, duration, grind setting, temperature override, bean info, TDS/EY, score, and tasting notes. This lets the AI see what changed between shots (e.g., "you went 2 clicks finer and the sourness improved").

**Multi-shot conversations**: Previous shots are summarized and compressed. Older messages get trimmed to manage token count.

### What the AI Now Knows (Profile Knowledge Base)

When the shot uses one of ~18 curated profiles, the system prompt includes:
- Expected curve shapes (pressure, flow, temperature behavior)
- What is intentional vs. problematic (e.g., declining pressure in D-Flow is by design)
- Roast suitability and grind guidance
- Duration and ratio expectations

This prevents the AI from flagging intentional profile behaviors as problems (e.g., D-Flow's declining pressure, Blooming's 30s pause, Allongé's high ratio).

**Profile matching** (three-tier priority):
1. **Direct KB ID**: `knowledge_base_id` stored in profile JSON (Decenza extension field, de1app ignores unknown keys) and persisted in the shots DB (`profile_kb_id` column, migration 9). Survives Save As, reboots, and profile inheritance.
2. **Fuzzy title matching**: `normalizeProfileKey()` strips accents (é→e), normalizes punctuation (& → and), then tries direct → prefix → substring match against KB section headers and aliases.
3. **EditorType fallback**: For custom-named D-Flow/A-Flow profiles, maps the recipe editor type ("dflow" → "d-flow / default", "aflow" → "a-flow").

**Implementation**: `ShotSummarizer::shotAnalysisSystemPrompt()` tries the direct KB ID first, then falls back to `matchProfileKey()` for fuzzy matching. `ShotSummarizer::computeProfileKbId()` computes the ID at profile load time and stores it on the `Profile` object. 31 stock profiles ship with `knowledge_base_id` baked into their JSON files.

**UI indicator**: Profiles with a knowledge base entry show a sparkle icon (from `qrc:/icons/sparkle.svg`) in the profile selector list. The `hasKnowledgeBase` flag is read from the JSON during `refreshProfiles()` and exposed through all profile list methods.

### What the AI Does NOT Know Today

1. What other profiles are available on the machine
2. What profiles might work better for the user's beans/roast (deferred until bean database integration)
3. Community recommendations for bean/profile pairings
4. Details about the roaster or bean beyond what the user typed
5. What other users' experiences are with the same beans

## Lessons Learned: Profile Knowledge Doesn't Scale (March 2026)

### The Problem

A user's D-Flow / Q conversation exposed three failures where the AI gave bad advice despite having relevant information:

1. **Wrong pressure range in knowledge base**: We hand-wrote "Pressure peaks ~8-9 bar" in profile_knowledge.md. The profile author (Damian) specifies "between 6 and 9 bar" in the de1app. The AI flagged a 7.7 bar peak as too low and recommended grinding finer — wrong advice.

2. **Temperature misdiagnosis**: D-Flow deliberately uses a low fill temperature (84°C) stepping to 94°C. The actual basket temperature reaches ~88°C by design — the 94°C setpoint just drives the heater to push hot water that mixes with the cooler pool. The AI saw a 6-8°C gap between target and actual and diagnosed "heat soak the machine longer" — completely wrong.

3. **Misleading observation from the summarizer**: The app's own `temperatureUnstable` flag fired on every D-Flow shot (average deviation from target > 2°C is guaranteed by the profile's temperature stepping design). This actively pointed the AI at the wrong problem.

The AI had to be corrected **twice** by the user before giving useful advice. The profile knowledge base entry, which was supposed to prevent exactly this, had the wrong numbers.

### Why Hand-Curated Knowledge Doesn't Scale

Fixing D-Flow required:
- Finding the profile description in the de1app editor code (it was hardcoded in UI, not in the `profile_notes` field)
- Finding Damian's forum posts explaining the temperature stepping design
- Checking Damian's website (coffee.brakel.com.au) for the correct pressure range
- Understanding how the DE1's heater/mixing behavior creates the temperature gap

This level of research per profile is not sustainable for 18+ profiles, especially for profiles by community authors who may not have published detailed explanations.

### What We Fixed

1. **Profile notes populated**: Added Damian's descriptions to `d_flow_q.json` and `d_flow_la_pavoni.json` — these flow into the AI prompt as "Profile intent" lines automatically.
2. **Corrected pressure range**: `profile_knowledge.md` now says "between 6 and 9 bar" matching the author.
3. **Added temperature explanation**: Knowledge base now explains the intentional temperature stepping and why the gap is by design.
4. **Grind-dependent curve shape**: Added that finer grinds produce flat pressure (boiler-like) while coarser grinds produce declining pressure (lever-like) — both valid.
5. **Softened temperature observation**: Changed from "Temperature unstable" (which sounds like a problem) to "Temperature deviation" with guidance to check profile notes before flagging.

### The Path Forward: Three Scalable Improvements

Rather than trying to deeply research every profile, we should make the AI better at interpreting what it already has.

#### 1. Profile Notes as Primary Authority (cost: 0 tokens)

The profile author's own description is the most reliable source of truth. The `notes` field in the profile JSON already flows into the prompt as "**Profile intent**". We need to:

- **Audit all shipped profiles** for empty or sparse notes. The de1app has notes for most profiles — verify they've been copied over (done March 2026: only D-Flow/Q and La Pavoni were missing, now fixed).
- **Check de1app editor code** for profiles whose descriptions are hardcoded in the UI rather than in `profile_notes` (D-Flow was the only case found).
- **Instruct the AI to trust profile notes over knowledge base** when they conflict. The filter system prompt already does this ("Always read and respect" the profile intent), but the espresso prompt is weaker — it says "Profile Intent is the Reference Frame" but doesn't explicitly prioritize notes over knowledge base entries.

#### 2. Recipe-Aware System Prompt (cost: ~200-300 tokens, cacheable)

The profile recipe is already in every prompt. A shot using D-Flow / Q includes:

```
1. Filling (25s) PRESSURE 6.0bar 84°C exit:p>3.0
2. Infusing (1s) PRESSURE 6.0bar 94°C
3. Pouring (127s) FLOW 1.8ml/s 94°C lim:10.0bar
```

An AI that understands DE1 physics can derive expected behavior from this recipe alone:
- Frame 1 at 84°C, Frame 2 at 94°C → intentional temperature stepping, expect actual temp to lag
- Frame 3 is FLOW-controlled → pressure is passive, will decline as puck erodes
- Frame 3 has 10 bar limiter → pressure "target" of 10 bar is a ceiling, not a goal

But the AI repeatedly failed to make these inferences. We should add explicit recipe-interpretation rules to the system prompt:

```
## Reading the Recipe for Expected Behavior

The profile recipe tells you what SHOULD happen. Use it to set expectations
before looking at actual data:

**Temperature stepping**: If frames use different temperatures (e.g., 84°C fill
→ 94°C pour), the actual temperature will ALWAYS lag behind the target. This is
physics — the heater pumps hot water that mixes with the cooler pool above the
puck. A 5-8°C gap between target and actual during temperature transitions is
normal and expected. Only flag temperature issues if actual temp deviates from
target during a STABLE phase (same temperature across consecutive frames).

**Flow-controlled pour with pressure limiter**: When a pour frame controls FLOW
(e.g., 1.8 ml/s) with a high pressure limiter (e.g., 10 bar), pressure will
peak based on puck resistance and then decline as the puck erodes. The limiter
is a safety ceiling. Pressure anywhere from 4 to the limiter value is normal.
The peak depends on grind — do not assume a specific peak value unless the
profile notes or knowledge base states one.

**Pressure-controlled fill/infuse → Flow-controlled pour**: This is the
lever/flow hybrid pattern (D-Flow, Londinium family). Pressure builds during
fill/infuse, then the switch to flow control means pressure becomes passive.
A declining pressure curve after the switch is the expected signature, not a
problem.

**Exit conditions**: Frames with exit conditions like "exit:p>3.0" advance to
the next frame when the condition is met. Short phase durations (1-2s) after
exit conditions are normal — the machine transitions quickly.
```

This is profile-independent guidance that improves advice quality across ALL profiles, including custom ones with no knowledge base entry. It's fully cacheable and costs ~250 tokens.

Community sources confirm these interpretation principles:
- Scott Rao (scottrao.com): Pressure curve volatility indicates channeling from clumped grounds and poor puck prep, not profile issues. The slope of pressure dropoff is characteristic of the grinder/burrs.
- Decent "5 profiles for medium" blog: D-Flow adapts behavior by grind — mimics 8.5 bar for fine grinds, Londinium for optimal, Gentle & Sweet for coarse.
- Decent "4 mothers" theory: Each mother category (lever, blooming, allongé, flat-9-bar) has fundamentally different expected curves. Roast level is the most important factor in choosing a recipe.
- home-barista.com community: DE1 set-point temperatures are generally lower than conventional machines, with 80s°C being common. Preference for shots where flow stabilizes immediately after preinfusion.

#### 3. Smarter Observations from the Summarizer (cost: 0 tokens — less noise)

The summarizer currently generates dumb flags based on simple thresholds. These should be recipe-aware:

**Temperature deviation** (partially fixed March 2026):
- Current: Flags when average deviation from target > 2°C.
- Problem: Always fires for profiles with temperature stepping (D-Flow, 80s Espresso, any profile with different fill/pour temps).
- Better: Check if the profile recipe has different temperatures across frames. If so, only check deviation during frames with stable temperature (same temp as previous frame). Or suppress the flag entirely and let the AI interpret using the recipe.

**Channeling detection**:
- Current: Flags sudden flow spikes during flow-controlled phases.
- Better: Also note the pressure curve slope — Scott Rao's observation that pressure curve volatility during extraction correlates with channeling and puck prep quality is a useful diagnostic. The slope of pressure decline is characteristic of the grinder/burrs, so erratic slopes (not smooth decline) are more indicative of channeling than a specific peak value.

**Pressure behavior** (not currently flagged, but could help):
- If the profile is flow-controlled and pressure peaks well below typical levels (< 4 bar), note this as potentially too coarse — but only as an observation, not a diagnosis.

### Refocusing the Knowledge Base

With recipe-aware interpretation handling expected curves and temperature behavior, the profile knowledge base (`profile_knowledge.md`) should shift focus to things that **cannot be derived from the recipe**:

| Keep in KB (not derivable) | Remove from KB (derivable from recipe) |
|---|---|
| Roast suitability per profile | Expected pressure curve shape |
| Flavor character and what profiles emphasize | Temperature behavior during stepping |
| Community dial-in tips (e.g., "stop at pressure elbow") | Which variable is controlled vs passive |
| Grind sensitivity and range | What the limiter means |
| Profile author's design philosophy | Phase transition behavior |
| Cross-profile comparisons ("more body than X, less clarity than Y") | |
| Known pitfalls ("if pressure hits max, grind is too fine") | |

This makes the KB smaller, more accurate (less room for wrong numbers like "~8-9 bar"), and focused on genuinely curated wisdom that adds value beyond what the recipe encodes.

### What Information We Still Need

The D-Flow fix was possible because Damian published detailed explanations. Most profile authors haven't. Here's what's missing:

#### Profile-specific gaps in the knowledge base

| Profile | Quality | What's missing |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **D-Flow** | Strong | Fixed March 2026. Author-sourced. |
| **A-Flow** | Medium | No author (Janek) design philosophy. Does A-Flow use temperature stepping? Are the 9-10 bar pressure numbers from Janek or our guess? No expected pressure range from author. |
| **Adaptive v2** | Good | Has Gagné's Coffee ad Astra post. |
| **Blooming Espresso** | Good | Has Rao's guidance. |
| **Blooming Allongé** | Medium | Who designed it? No dial-in tips beyond grind and pressure. |
| **Allongé / Rao Allongé** | Good | — |
| **Default** | Thin | Only 6 lines. No DO NOT flag instructions. When to use vs Best Overall or other lever profiles? |
| **Londinium/LRv3** | Good | — |
| **Turbo Shot** | Medium | Who designed it? No author-sourced dial-in guidance. |
| **Filter 2.0/2.1** | Good | — |
| **Sprover** | Medium | Sparse on dial-in tips. |
| **Gentle & Sweet** | Good | — |
| **Extractamundo Dos** | Medium | No author attribution. Why is it a community favorite? |
| **Flow Profile** | Thin | Only 6 lines. No author, no dial-in tips. |
| **Cremina** | Good | — |
| **80s Espresso** | Good | — |
| **Best Overall** | Medium | Sparse on dial-in tips. |
| **E61** | Good | — |

#### Systematic gaps (not profile-specific)

1. **No AI advice validation method.** We found the D-Flow problem because a user exported a bad conversation. We have no systematic way to test whether advice improved. Need: a set of test conversations (real or synthetic) that can be replayed against updated prompts.

2. **No user feedback loop for bad advice.** The enjoyment score rates the shot, not the advice. If the AI gives wrong recommendations, we only learn about it anecdotally. Could add: a simple "was this advice helpful?" signal after each AI response.

3. **Dial-in reference tables are collected but unused.** [`docs/ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md`](ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md) has structured multi-variable relationships (roast→temp→flavor, flow→clarity/body, pressure sweet spot, flavor correction). This is high-impact data that should be in the system prompt — it's Phase 1 item 5 but arguably should be Phase 0 given it directly improves advice quality.

4. **Espresso system prompt doesn't prioritize profile notes.** The filter prompt says "Always read and respect" the profile intent, but the espresso prompt only says "Profile Intent is the Reference Frame" — it doesn't explicitly tell the AI to trust profile notes over the knowledge base when they conflict. One sentence fix.

5. **Profile notes quality varies.** All shipped profiles have notes populated, but quality ranges from detailed (`blooming_espresso.json` — full paragraph explaining the technique) to minimal (`damian_s_q.json` — "A very popular profile made with D-Flow, spun out as its own profile"). The minimal ones don't help the AI much.

6. **Temperature stepping profiles beyond D-Flow.** We deeply researched D-Flow's temperature behavior. Other profiles also use temperature stepping (80s Espresso: 80→70°C, Filter 2.0: 90→85°C, many custom user profiles). The recipe-aware system prompt rules (proposed above) would cover all of these generically, but they're not implemented yet.

7. **A-Flow author knowledge.** A-Flow is the second most popular profile editor (after D-Flow) and the only other custom editor. Janek's design intent, expected ranges, and guidance are not well-documented in our KB. Source: check if Janek has published anything similar to Damian's coffee.brakel.com.au site.

### Priority (revised)

These improvements should be implemented before the other ideas in this doc (profile catalog, bean enrichment, cross-profile recommendations) because they improve advice quality for every shot at near-zero cost:

1. **Recipe-aware system prompt** — highest impact, addresses the root cause of the D-Flow failures. ~250 cacheable tokens. Should be implemented next.
2. **Espresso prompt: trust profile notes** — one sentence addition to espresso system prompt, matching what the filter prompt already does. 0 cost.
3. **Dial-in reference tables in system prompt** — move from Phase 1 to Phase 0. Data is already collected in ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md. ~800-1000 cacheable tokens.
4. **Smarter summarizer observations** — reduces noise that actively misleads the AI. Code change only, no token cost.
5. **KB refocus** — lower priority, do incrementally. Start with A-Flow (seek author guidance) and thin entries (Default, Flow Profile).
6. **Test conversations** — collect 5-10 exported AI conversations covering different profiles and failure modes. Use to validate prompt changes before shipping.

## Ideas for Improvement

### 1. Profile Catalog in System Prompt

**Problem**: The AI only knows about the current shot's profile. It can't recommend switching profiles or compare approaches.

**Approach**: Generate a compact one-liner per profile and include in the system prompt. Example:

```
D-Flow / default (Damian) — lever-style: 3bar PI, 1.7ml/s flow pour, 88C, espresso
Blooming Espresso — bloom 30s then declining pressure, 92C, espresso
Best Practice Light Roast — designed for light/Nordic roasts, 94-96C
Filter 2.1 — high-flow pour-over style, 96C, 1:15 ratio, filter
```

**Token cost**: ~80-100 chars/profile x ~95 profiles = ~2-3K tokens added to system prompt.

**With caching**: Anthropic 90% discount, OpenAI 50% automatic. Minimal incremental cost per request.

**Status**: Not implemented. Ready to build.

### 2. Curated Profile Knowledge Base

**Problem**: The profile catalog (idea #1) tells the AI what each profile *does* mechanically, but not what it's *for* — which roasts, which flavor goals, which skill level.

**Approach**: A curated resource file (text or JSON) encoding community wisdom per profile:

```
D-Flow / default:
  Best for: Medium to dark roasts
  Typical: 88C, 18g dose, 1:2.5-3 ratio
  Character: Forgiving puck prep, body-forward, classic espresso
  Not ideal for: Very light Nordic roasts (under-extracts)

Best Practice Light Roast:
  Best for: Light and Nordic roasts
  Typical: 94-96C, 18g dose, 1:2.5+ ratio
  Character: Clarity, brightness, needs precise puck prep

Blooming Espresso:
  Best for: All roasts, especially when seeking clarity
  Typical: 92C, bloom 30s, gentle extraction
  Character: Highlights origin flavors, lower body than traditional
```

**Who writes it**: Could be maintained by the developer/community, updated with app releases. Alternatively, seeded from community knowledge and refined over time.

**Status**: **Implemented.** Knowledge base lives in [`docs/PROFILE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`](PROFILE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md) (human-readable, source-tagged) and [`resources/ai/profile_knowledge.md`](../resources/ai/profile_knowledge.md) (AI-optimized, loaded as Qt resource). 18 profiles documented with expected curve behavior, temperature, flow rates, grind guidance, and "DO NOT flag" instructions. Data sourced from Decent blog posts, the "4 mothers" theory, and transcripts from three Decent video tutorials (light/medium/dark roast profiles). Profile matching in `ShotSummarizer::shotAnalysisSystemPrompt()` with fuzzy title matching and alias support.

### 3. User History Summary

**Same-profile dial-in history** — **Implemented.** When analyzing a shot, up to 5 recent shots with the same `knowledge_base_id` are included in the user prompt via `ShotHistoryStorage::getRecentShotsByKbId()`. Each historical shot includes the full profile recipe, grind setting, temperature, dose/yield, score, and tasting notes. This lets the AI track dial-in progression and correlate changes with results (e.g., "you ground 2 clicks finer and the sourness resolved").

**Cross-profile history** — Not yet implemented. The AI doesn't know the user's track record *across* different profiles. A session-level summary would enable:

```
YOUR PROFILE HISTORY (last 90 days):
- D-Flow / default: 47 shots, avg rating 78, mostly medium-dark beans
  Best: 85 rating, Ethiopian Sidamo, 18g->38g, 88C
  Worst: 52 rating, Kenyan AA light, 18g->36g, 88C
- Blooming Espresso: 12 shots, avg rating 84, mostly light beans
  Best: 92 rating, Kenyan AA, 18g->42g, 94C
- Never tried: Turbo Shot, Rao Allonge, Adaptive v2...
```

**Token cost**: ~1-2K tokens. Changes per session, not per request — could be cached as a second block.

**Enables**: "You've been averaging 78 on D-Flow with light roasts but 84 on Blooming. Your data suggests Blooming works much better for your light roasts."

**Status**: Same-profile history done. Cross-profile summary needs aggregation query + summary generation.

### 4. Bean Data Enrichment

**Problem**: Users type "Onyx Southern Weather" but the AI may or may not know the roast level, processing, origin, or recommended recipe. Small/local roasters and seasonal lots are unknown. Today the BeanInfoPage only captures: roaster, coffee name, roast date, roast level (dropdown), grinder, setting, barista. No origin, processing, variety, altitude, or roaster's tasting notes.

#### Existing Bean Data Sources (Research, March 2026)

| Source | Data | Size | API | Decent Ecosystem |
|--------|------|------|-----|-----------------|
| **Loffee Labs Bean Base + Roasters Registry** | **Bean Base**: roaster, name, origin, processing, variety, roast level, tasting notes (categorized by flavor family), price, body, description. **Roasters Registry**: roaster name, region, country, type, linked bean-base stats. Separate but linked databases rebuilt together in V4.0 — beans are children of roasters. | Thousands of coffees, hundreds of roasters | Yes (contact loffeelabs@gmail.com for access) | Already integrated with visualizer.coffee |
| **RoastDB** | Origin, variety, process, roast level, tasting notes, price | 4,500+ coffees, 472+ roasters, 30 countries | No public API (Next.js + SQLite web app) | None |
| **Visualizer.coffee coffee_bags API** | roast_date, origin (country, region, farm, farmer), variety, elevation, processing, harvest time, tasting notes, roast level, quality score | User's own data only (authenticated) | Yes (existing auth in Decenza) | Core integration already exists |
| **Beanconqueror** | Origin, variety, processing, roast level per bean | Per-user local data | No public search API | Indirect (both integrate with visualizer) |
| **Coffee Quality Institute DB** | 1,300+ arabica reviews: processing, country, farm, mill, quality metrics | Static dataset | GitHub CSV | None |
| **AI training data** | Major roasters' flagships and long-running blends | Broad but unreliable for seasonal/local | Free (part of AI call) | N/A |

**Key finding**: Visualizer's `coffee_bags` API has all the right fields (origin, variety, processing, elevation, tasting notes) but only returns the **user's own data** — it's not a community-searchable database. The community search layer is **Loffee Labs Bean Base**, which visualizer.coffee already uses for its "Search Loffee Labs Bean Base" feature.

#### Recommended Approach: Two-Tier Lookup

**Tier 1: Visualizer coffee_bags (user's own data, no new API needed)**
- Decenza already has visualizer auth (`VisualizerUploader` with token)
- The `coffee_bags` API has excellent fields: origin (country, region, farm, farmer), variety, elevation, processing, harvest time, tasting notes, roast level, quality score
- But it's **per-user only** — only returns bags the user has already entered in visualizer
- Useful for: auto-filling fields the user already entered on the visualizer side, avoiding double entry
- Zero new dependencies — just add a GET to the existing visualizer integration

**Tier 2: Loffee Labs Bean Base + Roasters Registry (community search, needs API access)**
- Thousands of curated coffees from hundreds of roasters
- **Two linked databases**: Bean Base (beans with origin, processing, variety, tasting notes, etc.) and Roasters Registry (roaster directory with region, country, type). Beans are linked to their roasters. Rebuilt together in V4.0 on shared codebase.
- Search by roaster + bean name returns structured data
- Already integrated with visualizer.coffee (the "Search Loffee Labs Bean Base" field in visualizer's UI goes through their API)
- **Requires API access from Loffee Labs** — Keith from LoffeeLabs responded (March 2026): API is undergoing extensive modernization. New API keys paused until new system launches. Beta access offered (~1 month), full production ~2-3 months. Free usage including post-launch. New API won't require manual key approval.
- Fallback when the user's own visualizer data has no match
- **Open questions for Loffee Labs** (follow up when they respond):
  1. Can we search by roaster name to get all their current beans?
  2. Does the API expose roaster details (location, website, type)?
  3. What's the bean ID format — is it the UUID that visualizer uses as `canonical_coffee_bag_id`?

**Visualizer <-> Bean Base linking via `canonical_coffee_bag_id`:**
The visualizer API has a `canonical_coffee_bag_id` field (UUID, nullable) on both `coffee_bags` and shots. This is the mechanism for linking to external databases like Bean Base. This means Decenza can:
- **Read**: Pull the user's coffee bags from visualizer, which may already have Bean Base links from the visualizer web UI
- **Write**: When user selects a Bean Base result in Decenza, create/update a `coffee_bag` on visualizer with the `canonical_coffee_bag_id` set to the Bean Base UUID — keeping visualizer in sync
- **Link shots**: When uploading shots, include `coffee_bag_id` to link shot -> bag -> Bean Base

This creates a full round-trip: Bean Base -> Decenza -> Visualizer -> Bean Base, so bean data entered in any app stays connected.

**Why this two-tier approach:**
1. Tier 1 is free and immediate — no new API keys, uses existing auth
2. Tier 2 provides community-wide coverage for new beans
3. User's own data takes priority (they may have corrected/customized fields)
4. Writing back to visualizer with `canonical_coffee_bag_id` keeps the ecosystem in sync

**Proposed flow:**
1. User enters roaster + bean name on BeanInfoPage
2. After both fields have text (debounced), Decenza queries:
   a. First: visualizer `coffee_bags` API (user's own data, filtered by name match)
   b. If no match: Loffee Labs Bean Base API (community search)
3. Results shown as suggestions or auto-fill prompt
4. Auto-fills: origin, processing, variety, roast level, roaster's tasting notes
5. User can accept, edit, or dismiss the enriched data
6. Enriched data stored on bean preset and passed to AI with shot analysis
7. If Bean Base result was used, create/update a visualizer `coffee_bag` with `canonical_coffee_bag_id` so visualizer stays in sync

**New fields needed on bean preset:**
- `origin` — Country/region (e.g., "Ethiopia, Guji")
- `processing` — Washed, Natural, Honey, Anaerobic, etc.
- `variety` — Caturra, Gesha, SL28, etc.
- `altitude` — Growing altitude if available
- `roasterTastingNotes` — Roaster's description (distinct from user's post-shot notes)
- `roasterRecommendedRecipe` — Dose/yield/temp if roaster provides it
- `beanBaseId` — For future lookups and cache invalidation

**What this enables for the AI:**
```
Today:     "Coffee: Onyx - Southern Weather"
Enriched:  "Coffee: Onyx - Southern Weather (Colombia, Huila. Washed Caturra,
            1700-1900m. Medium-light roast. Roaster notes: milk chocolate,
            brown sugar, mandarin orange)"
```

The AI can now say: "Your Colombian washed beans have chocolate/citrus notes — D-Flow at 88C should bring out the chocolate, but if you want more of the mandarin brightness, try raising temp to 91C or switching to Blooming Espresso."

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add new fields to `Settings::addBeanPreset()` / `updateBeanPreset()` and `ShotMetadata`
2. Create `BeanLookupManager` in `src/network/` for both visualizer and Bean Base queries
3. Add lookup trigger in BeanInfoPage QML (debounced, after roaster+bean entered)
4. Show enriched data in UI with accept/edit/dismiss
5. Pass enriched fields through to `ShotSummarizer::buildUserPrompt()`
6. Contact Loffee Labs for Bean Base API access (required for Tier 2)

**Fallback options (when neither tier has a match):**

**B. Lean on AI training data (free, immediate)**
- Add to system prompt: "If you recognize the roaster and bean, share what you know about roast level, processing, and flavor profile. If you don't recognize them, say so and ask the user."
- Pro: Zero implementation cost, works for major roasters
- Con: Unreliable for seasonal/small roasters, may hallucinate
- Can be implemented immediately as a stopgap

**C. Web search fallback**
- If Bean Base returns no results, optionally search the web for the roaster's product page
- Use the configured AI provider to extract structured data from the page
- Pro: Works for any roaster with a website
- Con: Adds latency, unreliable parsing, may not find small roasters

**D. Community-contributed via visualizer.coffee**
- Users who enter bean details build up shared data via visualizer's `coffee_bags` API
- When someone enters the same roaster/bean, details auto-populate from community data
- Pro: Accurate, grows over time, already has API
- Con: Requires visualizer premium for writes, slow to build critical mass

**Status**: Not implemented. Tier 1 (visualizer) ready to build. Tier 2: **Loffee Labs responded (March 2026)** — their API is being modernized; beta access offered in ~1 month, free usage. See dependency notes below.

### 5. Gemini Context Caching

**Problem**: Anthropic caches for 5 minutes, OpenAI caches automatically. But users who pull shots throughout the day (e.g., 30 minutes apart) lose the cache between shots.

**Approach**: Use Gemini's explicit Context Caching API to create cached content resources with longer TTL (minutes to hours). The system prompt + profile catalog would be cached once per session.

**Status**: Not implemented. Would be valuable if the profile catalog (idea #1) or knowledge base (idea #2) significantly increases the system prompt size.

### 6. Cross-Profile Recommendations

**Problem**: Even with a profile catalog, the AI needs guidance on *when* to recommend switching profiles.

**Approach**: Add a section to the system prompt:

```
## When to Suggest a Profile Change

Consider recommending a different profile when:
- The user's roast level mismatches the profile's design temperature
  (e.g., light roast on an 88C profile)
- Repeated shots show the same issue that a different profile addresses
  (e.g., always under-extracting → try a profile with longer preinfusion)
- The user asks about a different brewing style
  (e.g., "I want more clarity" → suggest a blooming or turbo profile)

Never suggest a profile change after a single shot unless the mismatch
is severe. Give the current profile 2-3 shots to dial in first.
```

**Status**: Not implemented. Depends on ideas #1 or #2 being in place first.

### 8. Structured Grinder + Burr Fields

**Problem**: The current `dyeGrinderModel` is a single free-text field (e.g. "DF83V"). This loses structure — the AI can't distinguish manufacturer from model, and has no idea what burrs are installed. For grinders with interchangeable burrs (Zerno Z1/Z2, DF64/83, EG-1, Lagom P64/P100, etc.), the burr set matters as much as the grinder for flavor advice.

**Approach**: Split the single "Grinder" field into three structured fields, following the same cascade pattern as beans (Roaster → Coffee):

```
Grinder Manufacturer → Grinder Model → Burrs
       "Turin"         →   "DF83V"    → "SSP HU 83mm"
       "Zerno"         →   "Z1"       → "SSP MPV2 64mm blind"
       "Eureka"        →   "Mignon Specialita" → ""  (no aftermarket burrs)
```

Each field cascades suggestions from history:
- **Manufacturer**: `getDistinctGrinderBrands()` — all brands the user has entered
- **Model**: `getDistinctGrinderModelsForBrand(brand)` — models for selected brand
- **Burrs**: `getDistinctGrinderBurrsForModel(brand, model)` — burr sets used with that grinder

**UI Layout** (BeanInfoPage):

```
Row 1: [Roaster]       [Coffee]    [Roast date]
Row 2: [Grinder brand] [Model]     [Burrs]
Row 3: [Roast level]   [Setting]   [Barista]
```

**Data Changes**:

| Component | Current | Proposed |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `Settings` | `dyeGrinderModel` (single string) | `dyeGrinderBrand`, `dyeGrinderModel`, `dyeGrinderBurrs` |
| `ShotHistoryStorage` DB | `grinder_model TEXT` | `grinder_brand TEXT`, `grinder_model TEXT`, `grinder_burrs TEXT` |
| `ShotMetadata` struct | `grinderModel` | `grinderBrand`, `grinderModel`, `grinderBurrs` |
| Bean presets | `grinderModel` | `grinderBrand`, `grinderModel`, `grinderBurrs` |
| Visualizer upload | `grinderModel` in notes | `grinderBrand + " " + grinderModel` in notes (backward compat) |
| FTS index | includes `grinder_model` | includes `grinder_brand`, `grinder_model`, `grinder_burrs` |
| AI prompt | "Grinder: DF83V" | "Grinder: Turin DF83V with SSP HU 83mm burrs" |

**Migration**: DB migration uses `src/core/grinderaliases.h` — a lookup table of ~90 grinders with aliases that map common user-typed strings to structured brand/model/stock_burrs. The migration:
1. Lowercase-normalizes the existing `grinder_model` string
2. Matches against aliases (e.g. "niche" → Niche/Zero, "df83v" → Turin/DF83V, "comandante" → Comandante/C40 MK4)
3. On match: populates `grinder_brand`, `grinder_model`, and auto-fills `grinder_burrs` with `stock_burrs`
4. On no match: keeps entire string in `grinder_model`, leaves `grinder_brand` and `grinder_burrs` empty
5. Aliases prioritize longer matches first to avoid "niche" matching before "niche duo"

**Burr Auto-Fill**: When the user selects a grinder manufacturer + model from the autocomplete dropdown, the burr field auto-fills with the stock/most popular burr from `src/core/grinderaliases.h`. For grinders with `burr_swappable: true`, clicking the burr field shows a picker with:
- Common burr options for that grinder size (from GRINDER_DATABASE.md aftermarket burr sets)
- Previously used burr values from shot history
- Free-text entry for custom burrs
For non-swappable grinders (e.g. Eureka Mignon, Comandante), the field auto-fills and is less prominent since the user can't change burrs.

**Backward Compatibility**: `dyeGrinderModel` getter could return `brand + " " + model` for any code that still reads the old combined field. Old bean presets with just `grinderModel` continue to work (loaded into `grinderModel`, `grinderBrand` stays empty).

**AI Impact**: With manufacturer, model, and burrs, the AI can look up the grinder in `GRINDER_DATABASE.md` and know:
- Burr size and geometry → appropriate grind range and sensitivity
- Burr flavor profile → expected taste characteristics
- Whether the grinder accepts aftermarket burrs → can suggest burr changes
- Adjustment resolution → how much one click/turn changes the grind

**Status**: Implemented in PR #368.

### 10. Espresso Dial-In Reference Tables in System Prompt

**Problem**: The current system prompt has only 3 lines for roast considerations and generic common patterns (gusher, choker, sour, bitter). It lacks structured multi-variable relationships — e.g., "what does higher flow rate do to clarity vs body?" or "how should infusion length change for different roast levels?"

**Source**: Åbn Coffee "Espresso tabel oversigt" — a community reference mapping 7 espresso variables against taste/texture outcomes. See [`docs/ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md`](ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md).

**What it adds beyond the current system prompt**:
1. **5-tier roast level matrix** — maps light→dark against acidity, clarity, extractability, mouthfeel, puck risk, puck prep importance, and specific flavor notes (fruits → caramel → choc+fruit → milk choc → dark choc). Current prompt only has 3 tiers with rough temp ranges.
2. **Grind→flow→pressure dynamics** — how grind affects channelling risk, the body/sweetness curve (less → more → less), clarity, flow limit behavior, and pressure decline patterns. Directly relevant to DE1 curve interpretation.
3. **Preinfusion tuning** — drip weight targets (4-10g vs 0.5g), move-on timing (30s vs 5s), and texture/body/clarity tradeoffs. Current prompt has nothing on preinfusion dialing.
4. **Pressure sweet spot** — 6-9 bar range with taste descriptions (thin/watery → clear delicate → rich traditional → muddy). Current prompt says "don't assume 9 bar" but doesn't explain what different pressures taste like.
5. **Flow rate → flavor pairing** — high flow favors florals/fruits with clarity; low flow favors chocolate/nuts with body. Plus flow rate recommendations per roast level and use-case ranges (milk drinks vs straight espresso).
6. **Gagné's ratio-flow formula** — `Flow = 4.867 - (6.6 × ratio)` — a concrete relationship between ratio and recommended flow rate.
7. **Flavor targeting & correction tables** — full matrix of "want more X → adjust Y in direction Z" for acidity, sweetness, body, clarity, wine-like texture. Plus correction tables for sourness, bitterness, burnt taste, thin taste, muddiness.
8. **TDS vs EY% taste mapping** — bitterness increases with both, sourness increases with high TDS + low EY, dark chocolate at high EY + low TDS. Useful when user provides refractometer data.

**Approach**: Add a "Dial-In Reference" section to `espressoSystemPrompt()` in `shotsummarizer.cpp`, between "Roast Considerations" and "Forbidden Simplifications". Compact representation (~800-1000 tokens) would be cacheable with Anthropic's 90% discount.

**Key sections to add**:
- Roast level → temperature + expected flavor profile (5 tiers)
- Flow rate → flavor affinity by roast level
- Preinfusion tuning (drip weight, move-on time, tradeoffs)
- Pressure sweet spot with taste descriptions
- Flavor correction quick-reference (sour→do X, bitter→do Y)
- TDS/EY interpretation guidelines

**Status**: Reference data collected in [`docs/ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md`](ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md). Not yet integrated into system prompt.

### 9. Conversation Context Layers

Summary of the layered context approach:

| Layer | Content | Size | Changes | Caching | Status |
|-------|---------|------|---------|---------|--------|
| Static knowledge | System prompt + curated profile knowledge base | ~2-2.5K tokens | Per app release | System prompt caching (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini) | **Done** |
| Recipe interpretation | Rules for deriving expected behavior from profile recipe (temp stepping, flow/pressure, limiters) | ~0.25K tokens | Per app release | System prompt caching | Proposed (see Lessons Learned) |
| Dial-in reference | Roast/grind/flow/pressure/ratio → taste tables, flavor correction guide | ~0.8-1K tokens | Per app release | System prompt caching | Data collected ([`ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md`](ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md)), not yet in prompt |
| Profile catalog | Compact one-liner per profile for cross-profile awareness | ~2-3K tokens | Per app release | System prompt caching | Not implemented |
| Bean enrichment | Origin, processing, variety, tasting notes from Bean Base/visualizer | ~0.5-1K tokens | Per bean preset | Included in user prompt | Not implemented |
| Dial-in history | Last 5 shots with same profile family (recipe, grind, temp, score, notes) | ~1-2.5K tokens | Every request | Not cacheable | **Done** |
| User history | Profile usage stats across all profiles, best/worst shots | ~1-2K tokens | Per session | Could be second cached block | Not implemented |
| Current shot | Shot data, phase breakdown, tasting notes | ~1-2K tokens | Every request | Not cacheable | **Done** |

Total context today: ~5-7K tokens. With all layers: ~12-16K tokens, with ~50-70% cacheable.

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 0: Fix interpretation quality (highest ROI, near-zero cost)
1. **Recipe-aware system prompt** — Add ~250 tokens of recipe-interpretation rules teaching the AI to derive expected behavior from the profile recipe (temperature stepping, flow-controlled pressure decline, limiter meaning, phase transitions). Addresses the root cause of the D-Flow failures. Improves advice for ALL profiles including custom ones with no knowledge base entry. Fully cacheable. See "Lessons Learned" section above.
2. **Espresso prompt: trust profile notes** — Add one sentence to espresso system prompt telling the AI to prioritize profile notes ("Profile intent") over knowledge base when they conflict, matching the filter prompt's existing "Always read and respect" language.
3. **Dial-in reference tables in system prompt** — Data already collected in [`docs/ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md`](ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md). Add ~800-1000 cacheable tokens covering roast→temp→flavor, flow→clarity/body, pressure sweet spot, preinfusion tuning, flavor correction guide. Moved up from Phase 1 — directly improves advice quality.
4. **Smarter summarizer observations** — Make `temperatureUnstable` flag recipe-aware: suppress or contextualize for profiles with temperature stepping across frames. Add pressure-slope analysis for channeling diagnosis. Code-only change, 0 token cost.
5. ~~**Profile notes audit**~~ — **Done** (March 2026). D-Flow/Q and La Pavoni were the only empty ones; now fixed. All other profiles confirmed populated.
6. **Refocus knowledge base** — Shift KB entries away from derivable curve behavior toward non-derivable wisdom: roast suitability, flavor character, community tips, cross-profile comparisons. Start with thin entries (Default, Flow Profile) and seek A-Flow author guidance.
7. **Test conversations** — Collect 5-10 exported AI conversations covering different profiles and failure modes. Use to validate prompt changes before shipping.

### Phase 1: Quick wins (no external dependencies)
1. **System prompt bean guidance** (idea #4 fallback B) — Add two sentences to system prompt telling the AI to share what it knows about recognized roasters/beans. Zero cost, immediate value.
2. **Profile catalog** (idea #1) — Generate compact profile summaries at build time, include in system prompt. Enables basic cross-profile awareness.
3. **Grinder knowledge base** — Curated database of ~150 grinders with burr size, type, material, adjustment sensitivity, and espresso suitability. See [`docs/GRINDER_DATABASE.md`](GRINDER_DATABASE.md). When user enters grinder model, AI can provide grind-setting guidance and explain grind characteristics for their specific burr geometry.
4. **Structured grinder + burr fields** (idea #8) — Split single "Grinder" field into Manufacturer / Model / Burrs with cascading autocomplete from history. Enables AI to look up exact grinder specs and burr flavor profile. See idea #8 for full design.
5. **Espresso dial-in reference tables** (idea #10) — Add multi-variable dial-in knowledge (roast→temp→flavor, flow→clarity/body, pressure sweet spot, preinfusion tuning, flavor correction guide, TDS/EY interpretation) to system prompt. Data collected from Åbn Coffee reference in [`docs/ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md`](ESPRESSO_DIAL_IN_REFERENCE.md). ~800-1000 additional tokens, fully cacheable.

### Phase 2: Bean enrichment
3. **Visualizer coffee_bags lookup** (idea #4 tier 1) — Query user's own visualizer data for bean details. No new API keys needed, uses existing auth. Avoids double-entry for visualizer users.
4. **Loffee Labs Bean Base integration** (idea #4 tier 2) — Contact Loffee Labs for API access. Community-wide search for beans not in user's visualizer data.
5. **New bean preset fields + AI integration** — Add origin, processing, variety, altitude, roaster tasting notes to bean presets. Extend `ShotSummarizer::buildUserPrompt()` to include enriched data.

### Phase 3: Personalization (app-side work)
6. ~~**Dial-in history per profile family** (idea #3 partial)~~ — **Done.** Up to 5 recent shots with the same `knowledge_base_id` are included in the user prompt with full recipe, grind, temp, dose, score, and tasting notes. Queried via `ShotHistoryStorage::getRecentShotsByKbId()`.
7. ~~**Curated profile knowledge base** (idea #2)~~ — **Done.** 18 profiles documented, integrated into system prompt via `shotAnalysisSystemPrompt()`.
8. **User history summary across profiles** (idea #3 remaining) — Aggregate shot history into per-session summary showing which profiles the user has tried, average ratings, best/worst combos. Would enable cross-profile recommendations.
9. **Cross-profile recommendation guidance** (idea #6) — Depends on #1 being in place. Deferred until bean database integration enables profile recommendations.

### Phase 4: Optimization
9. **Gemini context caching** (idea #5) — Implement when context size grows from above additions.
10. **Web search fallback** (idea #4 fallback C) — For beans not in Bean Base.
11. **Community bean data via visualizer** (idea #4 fallback D) — Longer-term, needs critical mass.
