## The 4 Mother Categories

All DE1 profiles descend from four fundamental approaches. `[SRC:4mothers]`

| Category | Pressure Style | Extraction Yield | Best Roast | Character |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Lever** | Peak ~8.6 bar, declining | 19-21% (lowest) | Dark to medium-dark | Rich chocolate, Italian-style, shortest contact time |
| **Blooming** | Extended preinfusion, gentle extraction | Highest | Medium to light | Maximum flavor extraction, nuanced notes |
| **Allonge** | Constant flow, low pressure | 21-23% | Ultralight | Bright fruit/floral, between espresso and filter |
| **Flat 9 Bar** | Constant pressure | Similar to lever | Dark | Simplified lever, less optimal curve |

## Profile Details

### D-Flow

- **Category**: Lever/Flow hybrid `[SRC:medium]`
- **How it works**: Combines pressure and flow control; pressurized pre-infusion followed by flow-controlled pour. Adapts to grind coarseness. Fast fill, pressurized soak at ~3 bar until scale reads target dripping weight (default 4g), then pressure rise with flow limit. `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Key advantage**: Ability to "heal" uneven puck preparation — the long pressurized soak under pressure repairs uneven puck distribution, producing linear extraction even when prep was poor `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Adjustable variables**: Dose weight, pre-infusion temperature, infusion pressure, extraction pressure `[SRC:dflow-blog]`
- **Default flow rate**: 1.7 ml/s pour `[SRC:medium]` (community typical range: 2.0-2.7 ml/s `[SRC:adaptive-adastra]`)
- **Default pressure limit**: 8.5 bar maximum during extraction `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Adaptive behavior**: Simplifies three profiles into one — if ground too fine, behaves like flat 8.5 bar E61; if dialed in correctly, behaves like Londinium (pressure then flow takeover); if too coarse, behaves like Gentle & Sweet (flow-limited, lower pressure) `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Pre-infusion**: Weight-based trigger (default 4g dripping) rather than time-based; requires a scale. Longer soak than Londinium possible because weight-triggered. `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Pressure curve**: Pressure rises after dripping target met; if flow exceeds 1.7 ml/s, flow control kicks in and pressure allowed to decline. Linear extraction line on flow chart indicates good extraction. `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Stopping strategy**: Stopping at the pressure elbow (where extraction stalls and pressure decline slows) is a winning strategy for flow-profiled shots `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Flavor**: With medium roast, concentrated mango, dried fruit, chocolate undertones. Floral/rose notes possible with medium-light beans. Tremendous aftertaste length. `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Light: Good — lower infusion pressure to 0 bar and increase dripping time for light roasts `[SRC:medium-video]`
  - Medium: Excellent — brings out floral/fruity notes (mango) while retaining chocolate undertones `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
  - Dark: Good `[SRC:medium]`
- **Best for**: Versatile, all roast levels; users who want forgiving puck prep. One of the three profiles most cited by users who "always make good espresso" (alongside Extractamundo Dos and Adaptive). `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`

### Adaptive v2

- **Category**: Flow/adaptive `[SRC:medium]`
- **How it works**: Rises pressure to 8.6 bar for ~4 seconds, then attempts sequential flow-rate steps from 3.5 ml/s down to 0.5 ml/s, locking in whatever flow rate exists when pressure peaks. Effectively adapts to grind size. `[SRC:adaptive-adastra]`
- **V2 change from V1**: Pre-infusion is no longer pressurized — water fills, hits high pressure briefly, then water is turned off and pressure declines on its own. This prevents gushing with large flat burr grinders and light roasts where pressurized soak would cause water to pour through. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Pre-infusion behavior**: Pressure rise times out after 7 seconds, then switches to stable flow at whatever pressure was achieved. With large flat burrs, expect significant dripping (17g dripping worked well in testing). Steep pressure decrease during dripping is normal with large burr grinders. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Pressure adaptation**: Adapts to grind coarseness — e.g., 6.8 bar peak with a coarser grind, up to 9 bar with fine grind. The pressure rise phase determines grind coarseness and sets the flow rate accordingly. `[SRC:light-video]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Flow range**: 2.0-2.7 ml/s (community data) `[SRC:adaptive-adastra]`
- **Shot duration**: 26-40 seconds (manual termination) `[SRC:adaptive-adastra]`
- **Ratio**: 1:2 to 1:3 `[SRC:adaptive-adastra]`. Best at shorter ratio (~1.8:1) for maximum fruitiness; longer ratios (2.3:1+) taste more like filter coffee with less brightness and mouthfeel `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Pressure curve**: Should peak near 9 bar then gradually decline. If pressure starts rising again during extraction, indicates fines migration (common with non-SSP burrs). `[SRC:adaptive-adastra]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Key advantage**: Tolerant of grind-size variation — too coarse produces allonge-style, too fine produces standard espresso, both potentially pleasant `[SRC:adaptive-adastra]`
- **Flavor**: Long aftertaste, layered flavors. Stone fruits (peach, pineapple). At shorter ratios: bright, fruity, good mouthfeel. At longer ratios: more filter-like, muted, thinner. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Grind**: Coarser than Londinium for same bean. Coarser grind extracts more easily due to better water flow (more clean solvent contact). `[SRC:light-video]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Light: Good (v2 updated to work with light roasts, previously medium-optimized) `[SRC:adaptive-search]` `[SRC:light-video]`
  - Medium-light: Excellent — balanced, layered, pronounced acidity. Can make medium-light beans taste like light roast with coarser grind. `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
  - Dark: Not recommended — letting pressure drop sacrifices mouthfeel on dark beans `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Best for**: Medium-light beans; users who want automated flow adjustment. One of the three profiles most cited by users who "always make good espresso." `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`

### Blooming Espresso

- **Category**: Blooming `[SRC:4mothers]`
- **How it works**: Fill at ~7-8 ml/s until pressure peaks, close valve for 30s bloom (aim for first drips around this time), then open to desired pressure. `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Grind**: Fine — grind as fine as manageable. Bloom allows use of finer grind. `[SRC:eaf-profiling]` `[SRC:rao-blooming]`
- **Ratio**: Useful up to 1:3 `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Total shot time**: ~70 seconds `[SRC:rao-blooming]`
- **Percolation**: After bloom, gently increase pressure to 8-9 bar, flow ~2-2.5 ml/s `[SRC:rao-blooming]`
- **Flavor**: Extremely high flavor intensity relative to ratio `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Dialing in guidance**: `[SRC:light-video]`
  - Should see water on bottom of puck almost immediately after fill. If it takes 3-4 seconds, grind is too fine.
  - Aim for 6-8g dripping on the scale before pressure rise begins.
  - Pressure during extraction should be 6-9 bar. **Never** hit maximum pressure — if pressure hits the brick wall of max allowed, grind is too fine and shot will be muted.
  - If pressure only reaches ~4 bar, grind is slightly too coarse (still drinkable but not optimal).
  - Ideally pressure rises and then declines (possibly dramatically) — this is normal.
  - Hardest profile to dial in. Requires multiple attempts to find the right grind. Do not attempt with only 250g of beans — need at least 3kg to properly experiment. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Paper filter trick**: Place a paper filter under the puck in the portafilter basket to prevent pressure crash. Especially helpful with new/unseasoned grinder burrs. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Extraction yield**: Highest of any espresso profile — typically 23-24%, up to 28-29% demonstrated by Scott Rao. Compare to cafe standard of 18-19%. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Light: Excellent — biggest extraction, most rewarding when dialed in. Hardest to dial in. Best with flawless beans in quantity. `[SRC:light]` `[SRC:light-video]`
  - Medium: Good `[SRC:4mothers]`
  - Dark: Not ideal (ultralight beans may experience puck degradation) `[SRC:4mothers]`
- **Best for**: Experienced users with good beans seeking maximum extraction. Not recommended for beginners or those with limited bean supply. `[SRC:light]` `[SRC:light-video]`

### Blooming Allonge

- **Category**: Blooming/Allonge hybrid `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Grind**: Ultra-fine or Turkish `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Fill**: ~7-8 ml/s until pressure peaks `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Bloom**: Close valve completely, bloom until pressure returns to 1 bar (typically 4-10g in cup) `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Percolation flow**: ~4.5 ml/s `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Pressure**: Should not exceed 6 bar `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Flavor**: Relatively thin and filter-like texture with high clarity `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Best for**: Ultra-light coffees, Nordic filter roasts, maximum flavor clarity `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`

### Allonge (Simple / Rao Allonge)

- **Category**: Allonge `[SRC:4mothers]`
- **Grind**: Coarsest of all espresso profiles by far (e.g., 1.8 on test grinder vs 0.5 for Blooming, 1.4 for G&S) `[SRC:eaf-profiling]` `[SRC:4mothers]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Flow rate**: ~4.5 ml/s — the fastest flow rate espresso the DE1 makes `[SRC:eaf-profiling]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Pressure**: ~4-6 bar. Pressure should hit target but not crash. If pressure hits max, flow will adjust down — this means grind is a smidge too fine. A few seconds of max pressure before puck erosion brings it down is acceptable. `[SRC:eaf-profiling]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Ratio**: 1:4-1:5 `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`; up to 1:5-1:6 for Rao variant `[SRC:adaptive-adastra]`
- **Time**: ~30 seconds `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Temperature**: Produces hot coffee — the fast flow means the puck doesn't have time to cool the water. Allow cup to cool briefly before drinking, or use a large ceramic cup. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Channeling**: Some channeling is normal and expected with Allonge due to the very fast flow rate. Don't be upset by it. A consistent needle of channeling adds slight dilution and acidity but is manageable. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Extraction yield**: 21-23% `[SRC:4mothers]`
- **Flavor**: Bright, intense fruit and floral; gives up thickness for clarity. Despite the fast flow rate, not especially acidic. About twice the strength of filter coffee. `[SRC:eaf-profiling]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Bean selection**: Best with natural/fermented/fruity beans with "crazy fruitiness." Less impressive with clean washed coffees — makes a pleasant but unremarkable drink. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Crema**: Still produces crema despite fast flow, because pressure creates crema `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Ultralight: Best — minimal puck integrity demands `[SRC:4mothers]`
  - Light: Excellent — easiest to dial in for light roasts, fruity/natural beans `[SRC:light]` `[SRC:light-video]`
  - Medium+: Not recommended
- **Best for**: Ultralight/light roasts, fruity or natural beans; midway between espresso and filter `[SRC:light]` `[SRC:light-video]`

### Default Profile

- **Category**: Lever `[SRC:medium]`
- **How it works**: Classic lever-style declining pressure, 8.6 to 6 bar `[SRC:medium]`
- **Versatility**: Mimics traditional 8.5 bar for fine grinds, behaves like Londinium for optimal grinds, limits flow for coarse grinds `[SRC:medium]`
- **Flavor**: Emphasizes chocolate intensity `[SRC:medium]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Medium: Excellent `[SRC:medium]`
  - Dark: Good `[SRC:medium]`
  - Light: Not recommended
- **Best for**: General use across grinders; medium to dark roasts `[SRC:medium]`

### Londinium / LRv3

- **Category**: Lever `[SRC:medium]`
- **How it works**: Inspired by spring-lever machines. Fast fill, then pressurized soak at ~3 bar until dripping appears, then ramp to ~9 bar with declining pressure. Emulates: lift lever (water fills), slam lever down (pressure hold), wait for dripping, release to full pressure, spring declines. `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Temperature**: 88C `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Versions**: `[SRC:dark-video]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
  - **LRv2**: If flow rate goes too fast at end of shot, switches from pressure-based to flow-based control (drops to ~1.7-2 ml/s). This "salvages" shots where puck erodes too much, preventing excessive acidity. May cause pressure crash but tames sourness.
  - **LRv3**: Pure lever decline — always pressure-controlled, just decreases pressure like a real lever. Preferred when dialed in perfectly. Different users prefer different versions.
- **Pressure curve**: Rises to ~9 bar, stays high during extraction. Pressure didn't decline much in dark roast testing (9 to ~8 bar) because flow was held constant by the declining pressure compensating for puck erosion. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flow curve**: Flow stays relatively constant — the declining pressure compensates for puck erosion, which is considered desirable `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Grind**: Fine grind required (same as Cremina). Finer than E61 or 80's Espresso. The pressurized soak requires finer grind to control dripping to 2-8g. `[SRC:dark-video]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Dripping target**: 2-8g of dripping during soak phase before pressure rise. If dripping exceeds ~17g, grind is too coarse. `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Extraction**: Highest extraction of dark roast profiles — the soak time extracts far more from the beans. Most full-bodied cup. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flavor**: Dark chocolate, smooth, full-bodied. Baker's chocolate intensity without excessive harshness. Much thicker crema than 80's Espresso due to longer time under pressure and higher temperature. Great for quality dark beans with subtlety. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Dark: Excellent — full body without harshness, highest extraction of dark profiles `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
  - Medium-dark: Good — finer grind, longer shot (45-53s) recommended. Powerful extraction. `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
  - Medium-light: Good — very fruity, long aftertaste, pleasing acidity. Works well with Ethiopian beans. `[SRC:medium-video]`
  - Light: Struggles — light roasts don't have the viscosity to survive the pressurized soak; water pours through and produces sour shot `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Best for**: Darker roasts seeking full body and smoothness; quality dark beans where you want maximum extraction `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`

### Gentle & Sweet

- **Category**: Pressure `[SRC:light]`
- **How it works**: Traditional espresso style — no pre-infusion, no hold, no dripping. Fills headspace, goes straight to 6 bar constant pressure, makes espresso. The puck compresses under flow, slows it down, then coffee flows out. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Pressure**: Constant 6 bar. Espresso is generally 6-9 bar; G&S sits at the low end. Under 4 bar you stop making crema and enter drip-coffee territory. `[SRC:gentle-search]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Flow curve**: Starts ~2 ml/s, increases to 3+ ml/s as puck erodes (because constant pressure against eroding puck = rising flow). This is characteristic and expected. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Shot duration**: Fast shot. Should not be long — if it takes 30+ seconds with a light roast, it will taste overextracted. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Extraction yield**: ~18-19% (lowest of the light roast profiles) `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Grind**: Does not require as fine a grind as Blooming or Adaptive. Works with less capable grinders. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Why 6 bar**: Lower pressure means less channeling. Light roasts resist pressure poorly — at 9 bar they channel, producing sour/watery shots. 6 bar is gentler. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Flavor**: Smooth, sweet, low acidity; good alone or with milk. Less complexity than aggressive profiles. Peach, ripe red apple, gentle fruit. Pleasant and easy to drink. `[SRC:gentle-search]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Key rule**: Light roasted coffee wants either a long pre-infusion OR fast flow. G&S provides fast flow (no pre-infusion). Flow should not be down at 0.5-1 ml/s — that's fine for dark roasts, not for light. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Light: Good — beginner-friendly entry point, extracts the least of light roast profiles `[SRC:light]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Best for**: Beginners to light roasts; those wanting a smooth, sweet cup; users with less capable grinders; first shot on a new DE1 `[SRC:light]` `[SRC:light-video]`

### Extractamundo Dos

- **Category**: Pressure `[SRC:light-video]`
- **How it works**: Very similar to Gentle & Sweet but with a short pre-infusion pause. Fills headspace, pauses for a few seconds (water sits on puck, some dripping occurs), then rises to ~6 bar target pressure. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Pressure**: Targets 6 bar, same as G&S. However, with the same grind setting the pre-infusion means it may not quite reach 6 bar — the extra soak creates less puck resistance. Slightly finer grind needed to match G&S pressure. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Flow curve**: Flow increases as puck erodes (like G&S) but not as dramatically due to the pre-infusion evening out the extraction. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Extraction**: Slightly more than G&S due to the short pre-infusion. Ordered: G&S < Extractamundo < Adaptive < Blooming < Allonge `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Flavor**: More acidic/sharp than G&S, fruitier, juicier. Higher concentration (TDS). Bitey-er and less gentle. Quick shot with fast flavor drop-off. `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Grind**: Same range as G&S, or slightly finer if you want to match 6 bar target pressure `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Popularity**: Most commonly cited profile among light-roast users who consistently make good espresso (from European tour survey with Scott Rao). One of the three profiles most cited by users who "always make good espresso." `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Light: Good — recommended if you don't have a lot of beans (more forgiving than Blooming) `[SRC:light]` `[SRC:light-video]`
- **Best for**: Light roast users wanting slightly more extraction than G&S; beans with slight off-flavors you want to hide; users with limited bean supply `[SRC:light]` `[SRC:light-video]`

### Flow Profile

- **Category**: Flow `[SRC:medium]`
- **How it works**: Maintains constant flow rate (1.7 ml/s for milky drinks version, 2 ml/s for espresso version). Pressure is allowed to rise and fall naturally based on puck resistance. `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Pressure curve**: Pressure rises as puck compresses (can reach ~9 bar if well-dialed), then declines linearly as puck erodes. The linear decline indicates clean extraction — no channeling. Inflection point (pressure elbow) indicates extraction has stalled. `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Flow versions**: Two variants — "for milky drinks" (1.2-1.7 ml/s, finer grind, 40-50s shot) and "for espresso" (2 ml/s, coarser grind, faster shot). Must match flow rate to grind size. `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Dialing in**: Grind should produce pressure between 6-9 bar. The tricky part is matching flow rate to grind/dose combination. `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Flavor**: Fruitier, more nuanced than Default; more complex flavor development. Dramatically different taste from pressure profiles even on same bean — fruit and floral notes emerge, longer aftertaste. More delicate presentation. `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Stopping strategy**: Pulling as a ristretto (stopping at pressure elbow) is often ideal — extraction is essentially done when pressure stops declining. `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Medium: Good — brings out unexpected fruitiness from beans that taste only chocolatey on Default `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`
- **Best for**: Milky drinks and nuanced espresso; users who want to explore flow profiling theory `[SRC:medium]` `[SRC:medium-video]`

### Cremina

- **Category**: Lever `[SRC:dark]`
- **How it works**: Emulates the Cremina lever machine. Fast fill with a brief soak/dwell, then pressure rises. Key difference from Londinium: pressure declines steeply as shot progresses (Londinium stays high). Flow rate drops as shot continues — this is by design. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Temperature**: 92C — 4C higher than Londinium (88C). The higher temperature extracts more, producing more intense/traditional Italian flavors but also more harshness. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Shot duration**: ~45 seconds — a long shot. Really long shots with thick pucks and thick espresso. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flow curve**: Flow rate drops as shot progresses. The declining pressure deliberately slows flow to maintain coffee thickness/concentration as the puck erodes. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Pressure curve**: Rises to peak then declines steeply (unlike Londinium which stays high). The steep decline is intentional — as the puck erodes, lowering pressure prevents increasingly watery coffee from coming through. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Grind**: Fine grind — same as Londinium and Best Overall. Finer than 80's Espresso or E61. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Mouthfeel**: Maximum mouthfeel of all profiles. Thick, syrupy espresso. Very thick crema — so thick a spoon cannot easily separate it. Consider pairing with a waisted basket (12g) for even thicker puck and more lever-like experience. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flavor**: Baker's chocolate, intense, some burn/char notes. Not fruity at all. Like a traditional Italian petrol-station espresso at higher temperature. Maximum "wake-me-up" intensity. Longest aftertaste of dark roast profiles. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Dark: Excellent — maximum mouthfeel and extraction intensity `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Best for**: Classic Italian espresso; maximum mouthfeel; ristretto pulls; users who want the thickest, most intense dark roast extraction. Also good candidate for waisted basket (12g). `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`

### 80's Espresso

- **Category**: Lever/Pressure `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **How it works**: Lever profile at LOW temperature. No pre-infusion — maximum water flow fills the puck, puck compresses, then flows out with declining pressure. Named "80's" because temperature starts at 80C and declines toward 70C. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Temperature**: 80C declining to ~70C — at least 8C cooler than normal espresso, 15C less than traditional machines (95-96C). The low temperature is the key innovation: dark tar flavors are extracted less at lower temperatures. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flow rate**: Ideally 1-1.2 ml/s (slow and thick). If flow is too fast (~1.9 ml/s with 18g basket), shot will be thin and dusty. Slow flow = more mouthfeel and smoother result. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Grind**: Slightly coarser than lever profiles (Londinium/Cremina/Best Overall) but finer than E61. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Ratio**: 2:1 traditional, but works well at 1:1 (ristretto) — more like Italian-style small espresso. Pull shorter if getting bitter/dusty flavors. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **With 18g basket**: ~25 second shot, flow peaked at ~1.9 ml/s. Can be thin and dusty — too fast. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **With 12g waisted basket** (recommended): ~37 second shot. Flow peaked at 2.4 ml/s, ended at 0.5-1 ml/s. Much smoother, thicker crema with tiger striping, minimal channeling, minimal spray. Worlds better than 18g version. The thicker puck from narrower basket gives less channeling and more mouthfeel. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flavor**: Bread fruit, raisins, baker's chocolate without the burn. Intentionally under-extracted (low temperature = less extraction). This is the least tar/burnt extraction method for dark beans. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Dark: Good — minimizes tar/burnt flavors that dark beans always have `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Best for**: Getting fruity flavors from dark roasts; minimizing burnt/tar notes; users who don't like dark roast defects. Best results with waisted (12g) basket for thicker puck. `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`

### Best Overall

- **Category**: Lever/Pressure `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **How it works**: 3-step simple profile from the appendix of Scott Rao's espresso book ("Best Overall Pressure Profile"). Fast fill (no soak/dripping time), rise to ~8.6 bar, then declining pressure to ~6 bar. Stays within the 6-9 bar espresso range throughout. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Temperature**: 88C `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Pressure curve**: Fast fill (~5 seconds to saturate puck), pressure rises quickly to ~8.6 bar, then slowly declines. The declining pressure compensates for puck erosion, keeping flow rate relatively constant — same principle as lever machines. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flow curve**: Flow stays pretty constant because declining pressure offsets puck erosion. This is considered desirable. If well-dialed, looks identical to flow-profiled shots. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Grind**: Fine grind — same as Londinium and Cremina (for long ~45s shot style). `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Fast fill importance**: Critical for dark roasts — fast fill minimizes channeling and maximizes body. Slow fill with dark roasts = more channeling, uneven extraction, less body. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Simple profile**: Uses the 3-step editor (pre-infusion, rise, decline) — easy to edit with sliders to adjust acidity/flavor balance. Adjusting end pressure between 4-6 bar gives pleasing balance of acidity to other flavors. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Crema**: Less crema than Cremina (much less time under high pressure). `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flavor**: Less extracted than Londinium or Cremina. Smooth, easy drinker. Not much acidity. Baker's chocolate without extreme intensity. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Dark: Good — an easier, smoother dark roast espresso `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Best for**: Milky drinks (latte, flat white) — no acidity, just a nice smooth shot that mixes well with milk. Less crema is actually preferable for milk drinks. `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`

### E61

- **Category**: Flat 9 bar / Pressure `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **How it works**: Flat 9 bar constant pressure, no pre-infusion. Very fast fill, pressure rises smoothly, then sustains 9 bar throughout. Simplest possible espresso profile — the DE1 version has perfectly stable temperature (unlike real E61 machines which are notoriously temperature unstable). `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Temperature**: 92C. Real E61 machines vary wildly in temperature due to their design (steam-temperature water cooling through exposed chrome group head). `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flow curve**: Flow starts moderate and increases as puck erodes — this is the characteristic E61 behavior. The constant 9 bar against an eroding puck drives flow up, which is why shots should be kept short. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Shot duration**: 22-25 seconds (shorter than lever profiles). First attempt at 15 seconds was too fast (too coarse). Dialed-in shot was 24 seconds. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Grind**: Coarsest of the dark roast profiles tested (coarser than Londinium, Cremina, Best Overall, and 80's). `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Characteristic sourness**: Some acidity/sourness is inherent because constant 9 bar + increasing flow toward end of shot = more acidic extraction. Longer shots = more sourness. This is why E61 shots should be shorter. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Crema**: Fair amount of crema — sustained 9 bar pressure creates crema (pressure + CO2 outgassing from fresh beans). `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Flavor**: Baker's chocolate with some balanced acidity. Less bitterness than Cremina. The faster flow rate and some acidity makes it John's personal favorite straight espresso from dark beans — he likes the acidity balanced with other flavors. Shorter shot time (~24s) may prevent tar flavors from emerging despite high temperature. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Editability**: The 3-step simple editor can transform E61 into many historical profiles: add pre-infusion (line pressure E61 evolution), add declining pressure (Cremina-like), or adjust decline rate to control acidity. End pressure between 4-6 bar gives good acidity balance. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Grinder note**: For dark roasts on E61, fines-producing grinders (like Niche, or fast RPM 60mm flat burrs) help maintain puck integrity and keep flow from increasing too fast. `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Roast suitability**:
  - Dark: Good — balanced acidity, shorter shot prevents over-extraction `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`
- **Best for**: Balanced acidity with dark roasts; users who enjoy some brightness in dark espresso; starting point for tinkering with the 3-step editor `[SRC:dark]` `[SRC:dark-video]`

### Turbo Shot

- **Category**: Flow/Pressure hybrid `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **How it works**: Full pump output (~7-8 ml/s), reduce to maintain ~6 bar `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Grind**: Medium-fine — coarser than typical espresso, fine enough to spike to 6 bar quickly `[SRC:turbo-search]`
- **Dose**: 15-17g (smaller than traditional) `[SRC:turbo-search]`
- **Ratio**: 1:2-1:3 `[SRC:turbo-search]` `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Temperature**: 92-95C `[SRC:turbo-search]`

- **Ratio**: 5:1 extraction, then dilute with 225-250g water `[SRC:filter-blog]`
- **Extraction yield**: 23-26% at 1.4-1.5% strength `[SRC:filter-search]`
- **Flow rate**: 3 ml/s (essential) `[SRC:filter-blog]`
- **Pressure limit**: 3 bar safeguard `[SRC:filter-search]`
- **Grind**: Finer than any filter grind, not quite espresso `[SRC:filter-blog]`
- **Setup**: Two micron 55mm paper filters in bottom, metal mesh on top `[SRC:filter-blog]`
- **Roast adjustment**: Lower temperature for darker or defective roasts `[SRC:filter-search]`
- **Best for**: Filter-style coffee from the DE1; high extraction, clarity `[SRC:filter-blog]`

### Sprover (Filter-Style)

- **Category**: Filter `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Dose**: Under-basket (e.g., 15g in 20g basket) `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Grind**: Coarser than allonge `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Flow rate**: 1.5-4.5 ml/s `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Pressure**: Keep below 1.5 bar during fill `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Ratio**: 1:10-1:14 `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Time**: ~100 seconds `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Starting point**: 15g:195g, 2 ml/s, ~100s `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Optional**: Paper/micromesh filter under puck to reduce oils and fines `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`
- **Best for**: Filter coffee simulation in espresso machine `[SRC:eaf-profiling]`

## General Roast-Level Advice

### Light Roasts
- Higher temperatures needed (93-96C for espresso) `[SRC:turbo-search]`
- Longer ratios (1:2.5-3, or up to 5:1 for fast shots) `[SRC:rao-approach]`
- Shot times commonly exceed 40 seconds — let taste guide, not the clock `[SRC:eaf-beginner]`
- Profiles ordered by increasing extraction: Gentle & Sweet < Extractamundo < Adaptive < Blooming < Allonge `[SRC:light]`
- Tested with: Chelchele from L'Alchimiste, 18g dose, 98mm flat burr grinder `[SRC:light]`

### Medium Roasts
- Medium-light: chocolate without bitterness `[SRC:medium]`
- Medium-dark: removes fruit but avoids char `[SRC:medium]`
- Comfortable base for espresso or milk drinks `[SRC:medium]`
- Stopping at the pressure elbow during flow profiling is often a winning strategy `[SRC:medium]`
- No "correct" profile — taste preferences dictate choices `[SRC:medium]`
- Darker roasts suit pressure-focused profiles (Default/Londinium); lighter roasts benefit from flow-based (Adaptive/D-Flow) `[SRC:medium]`
- Tested with: medium-light from L'Alchimiste, medium-dark from Dark Arts `[SRC:medium]`

### Dark Roasts
- High solubility — lever/pressure profiles work naturally `[SRC:4mothers]`
- Lower temperatures (88-91C) to avoid over-extraction `[SRC:turbo-search]`
- Shorter ratios (1:1.5-2) to prevent bitterness
- 3-stage profiles can be edited with sliders to adjust acidity/flavor balance `[SRC:dark]`

### Universal Advice
- Lock in dose based on basket rating (e.g., 18g in 18g basket) `[SRC:eaf-beginner]`
- Start with 1:2 ratio, adjust by taste `[SRC:eaf-beginner]`
- Grind as fine as possible while maintaining a tasty, balanced shot `[SRC:eaf-beginner]`
- When switching coffees at similar roast level, adjust only the grind `[SRC:rao-approach]`
- If sour: increase ratio. If bitter: shorten ratio. If both: fix puck prep. `[SRC:eaf-beginner]`
- Temperature: lower extracts less, higher extracts more — adjust after locking dose/ratio/grind `[SRC:eaf-beginner]`
