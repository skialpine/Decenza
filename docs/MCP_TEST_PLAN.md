# MCP Tool Test Plan

Sequential runbook to verify all MCP tools work correctly as a second UI to the QML app. Each test has explicit tool calls, expected results, and cleanup steps. Tests must be run in order — later tests depend on state from earlier ones.

## Prerequisites

- App running (simulator or production)
- MCP connected (`/mcp` in Claude Code)
- Machine in Ready or Sleep state (not mid-operation)

## State Capture (run before tests)

Save these values — they will be restored at the end:
```
Call: profiles_get_active
Save: ORIGINAL_PROFILE = filename, ORIGINAL_MODIFIED = modified

Call: profiles_get_params
Save: ORIGINAL_TEMP (tempStart for recipe, espresso_temperature for advanced)

Call: settings_get
Save: ORIGINAL_BRAND = dyeBeanBrand, ORIGINAL_GRIND = dyeGrinderSetting
Save: ORIGINAL_BEAN_TYPE = dyeBeanType, ORIGINAL_ROAST = dyeRoastLevel

Call: machine_get_state
Save: ORIGINAL_PHASE = phase (if Sleep, will wake for tests then re-sleep at end)
```

If ORIGINAL_MODIFIED is true, warn the user — tests will modify the profile and the unsaved changes will be lost.

## Run Log

                      confirmed: true)

Step 3 — Restore machine phase (if was sleeping):
  If ORIGINAL_PHASE was "Sleep":
    Call: machine_sleep (confirmed: true)

Step 4 — Verify clean state:
  Call: profiles_get_active → filename = ORIGINAL_PROFILE, modified = false
  Call: settings_get → dyeBeanBrand = ORIGINAL_BRAND, dyeGrinderSetting = ORIGINAL_GRIND
  Call: machine_get_state → phase matches ORIGINAL_PHASE (or Ready if was Ready)
```

### What this test plan does NOT leave behind
- No temporary profiles on disk (`_mcp_test_tmp` deleted in 4.10, `default` override reverted in 4.11)
- No modified DYE metadata (restored in cleanup step 2)
- No modified grinder setting (restored in 7.3 cleanup and cleanup step 2)
- No permanently altered shot feedback (restored in 6.5 cleanup)
- No changed machine phase (restored in cleanup step 3)
- Active profile and temperature restored to pre-test values
