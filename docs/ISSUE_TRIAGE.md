## Tier 2 — Crashes (stability)

| Priority | # | Issue | Notes |
|----------|---|-------|-------|
| 5 | #139 | Android BLE receiver leak | `Too many receivers (1000)` after long sessions. Qt BLE bug, Teclast P80X, Android 9 |
| 6 | #156 | iOS SIGSEGV during BLE write retry | Crash in FrameWrite timeout handler on iOS 26.1 |
| 7 | #148 | iOS SIGSEGV on app resume | Crash writing to Skale after ~30hr suspend/resume |
| 8 | #149 | Android DeadSystemException | System-level BLE crash on TrebleDroid. Low actionability |

## Tier 3 — Significant Bugs

| Priority | # | Issue | Notes |
|----------|---|-------|-------|
| 9 | #134 | Notes persist despite "clear" setting | Notes keep uploading to Visualizer repeatedly |
| 10 | #59 | Auto Sleep not working | Machine stays on. Old report (v1.2.8), no fix found |
| 11 | #126 | Water level not sent to DE1 | Refill trigger wrong. May be Decent API issue |

| 15 | #132 | Weight data wrong on Visualizer | Cumulative weight instead of flow rate. PR #138 may address |
| 16 | #69 | Flow graph shows cumulative weight | Related to #132. Design decision |
