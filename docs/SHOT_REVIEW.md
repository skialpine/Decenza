# Shot Review: Current State

This is a snapshot of how the post-shot review and shot detail pages work today,
focused on the quality-badge / detector system and the Shot Summary dialog that
share the same underlying analysis. It is the source of truth for anyone modifying
detectors, persistence, the badge UI, or the summary text; the `git log` for
`docs/SHOT_REVIEW.md` (and its prior name `SHOT_REVIEW_IMPROVEMENTS.md`) is the
source of truth for the path that got us here.

The detectors are still under active iteration — expect this doc to drift, and
prefer reading the code (`src/ai/shotanalysis.h` is heavily commented) when in
doubt.

---

## 1. What the user sees

### Pages

Both **PostShotReviewPage** (auto-opens when a shot ends) and **ShotDetailPage**
(opened from history) render the same shot data with the same components. A
shared `shotReview/advancedMode` setting toggles information density on both.

### Basic mode (default)

- Graph: pressure, flow, temperature, weight, weight flow rate.
- Goal overlays for pressure / flow / temperature (dashed).
- Phase markers (frame boundaries) without label text.
- Quality badges (one or more chips below the graph).
- Metrics: duration, dose, output, ratio, rating.
- Notes, bean / grinder info, barista.

### Advanced mode adds

- Resistance (P/F), Darcy resistance (P/F²), conductance (F²/P), dC/dt, mix
  temperature curves (toggleable in the legend).
- Phase marker label text (frame boundaries with transition reasons —
  `[W]` weight, `[P]` pressure, `[F]` flow, `[T]` time).
- Phase summary panel — collapsible per-phase metrics table.
- TDS / EY fields (review page) and analysis card + debug log button (detail
  page).

### Quality badges

Five flags, surfaced via `qml/components/QualityBadges.qml`. When any fire,
those chips show; when none fire, a single green "Clean extraction" chip
shows. A tappable "Shot Summary" chip always sits at the end of the row —
it's the entry point to the analysis dialog described in §3.

| Flag                       | Color  | Label                  | Source                       |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `pourTruncatedDetected`    | red    | "Puck failed"          | `detectPourTruncated`        |
| `channelingDetected`       | red    | "Channeling detected"  | `detectChannelingFromDerivative` |
| `temperatureUnstable`      | orange | "Temp unstable"        | `avgTempDeviation` + threshold |
| `grindIssueDetected`       | orange | "Grind issue"          | `detectGrindIssue` (`analyzeFlowVsGoal`) |
| `skipFirstFrameDetected`   | red    | "First step skipped"   | `detectSkipFirstFrame`       |

**Suppression cascade.** `pourTruncatedDetected` is dominant: when it fires,
`channelingDetected` / `temperatureUnstable` / `grindIssueDetected` are
forced to false at save time, in the load-time recompute, and inside
`analyzeShot`. The puck failed to build pressure, so the curves the
other three detectors read off don't mean what they normally mean
(conductance saturates → derivative flat, flow tracks preinfusion goal →
grind delta ≈ 0, temp drift measured against a pour that didn't really
happen). `skipFirstFrameDetected` is **not** suppressed — it's a
machine/profile issue orthogonal to puck integrity. The clean-extraction
green chip's visibility gate also includes `!pourTruncatedDetected` so a
suppressed puck-failure shot can't fall through to the wrong all-clear.

The badges are recomputed on every shot load (see §4) so detector improvements
take effect on existing shots without a manual re-analyze.

---

## 2. Detector internals

All five detectors live in `src/ai/shotanalysis.{h,cpp}` as static methods on
`ShotAnalysis`. Tuning constants are defined at the top of the header so they
can be tweaked in one place. The header is heavily commented — read it
alongside this section.

### 2.1 Channeling

Single source of truth for channeling severity is `detectChannelingFromDerivative`,
operating on the Gaussian-smoothed conductance derivative `dC/dt`. The badge
fires on the **Sustained** severity tier; the **Transient** tier surfaces only
in the Shot Analysis dialog popup.

**Severity tiers** (`ChannelingSeverity`):

- **None** — no sample's `|dC/dt|` exceeds `CHANNELING_DC_TRANSIENT_PEAK` (5.0).
- **Transient** — a single peak above 5.0 (a self-healed channel).
- **Sustained** — more than `CHANNELING_DC_SUSTAINED_COUNT` (10) samples above
  `CHANNELING_DC_ELEVATED` (3.0) **inside the inclusion windows**.

**Inclusion windows** are built by `buildChannelingWindows`. Without windowing
the detector flags every lever-style preinfusion as channeling because the
natural pressure-rise dynamic drives `dC/dt` strongly negative. A sample is
included only when, at that time:

1. The active control goal (flow goal during flow-mode phases, pressure goal
   during pressure-mode phases) is **stationary**: `|goal(t±0.75 s) − goal(t)|
   / goal(t) ≤ 0.15` on both sides.
2. The actual value has **converged** onto the goal: `|actual − goal| / goal ≤
   0.15`.
3. Actual pressure is not rising fast in either mode: when
   `pressureNow > 0.5` bar AND `pressureFut > pressureNow * 1.15` over 0.75 s
   ahead, the sample is disqualified. Two ramp dynamics produce the same
   conductance-drop signature and are both gated here:
   - Flow-mode lever rise (Cremina, Damian LRv3, 80's Espresso preinfusion):
     flow goal stationary while the puck builds pressure under a pressure-
     ceiling exit.
   - Pressure-mode rise-and-hold final leg: pressure goal locked at target
     but actual pressure still ramping toward it. The 15 %-of-goal
     convergence check admits these samples because actual is close enough
     to goal, even though it is still climbing fast — `dC/dt` clamps at the
     negative floor as conductance drops with pressure. (Shot 889 on 80's
     Espresso was the motivating false positive.)
   Falling pressure is always allowed — bloom transitions and
   pressure-mode → flow-mode handoffs are legitimate channeling signals,
   and the dC/dt detector counts both signs of conductance change as
   diagnostic. The 0.5 bar precondition gates out the near-atmospheric
   window where small absolute jitter would otherwise read as a 15 %
   relative rise.

Contiguous qualifying times collapse into windows; gaps ≤
`WINDOW_GAP_MERGE_SEC` (0.3 s) are merged.

**Fallback semantics** are deliberate:

- Empty `phases` → emits a single whole-pour window (legacy shots predating
  phase markers run unrestricted, preserving coverage).
- Non-empty `phases` but no qualifying window → returns empty, and
  `detectChannelingFromDerivative` reports `None` (not unrestricted). This is
  the "all-ramp shot, nothing reliable to analyze" path; better to be silent
  than to false-positive.

**Pour-window trim**: the first `CHANNELING_DC_POUR_SKIP_SEC` (2.0 s) and last
`CHANNELING_DC_POUR_SKIP_END_SEC` (1.5 s) of the pour are excluded from the
detector's time grid — they cover the pressure-ramp / flow-catchup transient
at start and the natural tail acceleration at end. `buildChannelingWindows`
applies the same trim to its output bounds.

**Hard skips** (`shouldSkipChannelingCheck` returns true → `channelingDetected`
forced to false):

- Beverage type is `filter`, `pourover`, `tea`, `steam`, or `cleaning`.
- Average flow during the pour exceeds `CHANNELING_MAX_AVG_FLOW` (3.0 mL/s) —
  turbo / very-coarse shots have no diagnostic dC/dt signal.

**Profile-level skip**: a `channeling_expected` flag in `ProfileKnowledge`
(reached via `ShotSummarizer::getAnalysisFlags(profileKbId)`) suppresses
channeling detection for profiles where channeling-shaped curves are intentional.

### 2.2 Grind issue

Implemented by `detectGrindIssue`, which delegates to `analyzeFlowVsGoal` and
returns true when either arm fires. Two arms run **additively**, not as
fallback — a clean flow-mode preinfusion can hide a pressure-mode choke and
vice versa.

**Arm 1: flow-vs-goal averaging** (the "primary" path).

For each flow-mode phase, builds an inclusive time range:

- Skip the first `GRIND_PUMP_RAMP_SKIP_SEC` (0.5 s) of the first flow-mode
  phase that coincides with `pourStart` — pump-ramp lag, not a grind signal.
- If the phase exits via `transitionReason == "pressure"`, skip the trailing
  `GRIND_LIMITER_TAIL_SKIP_SEC` (1.5 s) — the firmware's pressure ceiling has
  engaged and the controller is no longer tracking flow goal.
- Both trims are gated on the resulting range remaining ≥ 1 s long. Extreme
  puck-failure shots with sub-second flow-mode phases would otherwise have
  their entire data trimmed away.

Within those ranges, average actual flow vs. flow goal across all samples
where `goal ≥ FLOW_GOAL_MIN_AVG` (0.3 mL/s — gates out preinfusion sentinel
goals). Requires ≥ 5 qualifying samples to yield a result. The check fires
when `|delta| > FLOW_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD` (0.4 mL/s); positive delta = coarse,
negative = fine.

**Arm 2: choked-puck check** (pressure-mode only).

For each pressure-mode phase (or the whole pour window if all phases are
flow-mode-labeled), accumulate samples where `pressure ≥
CHOKED_PRESSURE_MIN_BAR` (4.0). Requires `flowSamples ≥ 5` and
`pressurizedDuration ≥ CHOKED_DURATION_MIN_SEC` (15 s) to fire. Two
sub-arms feed `chokedPuck`:

- **Severe (flow arm)**: mean pressurized flow `< CHOKED_FLOW_MAX_MLPS` (0.5
  mL/s). Catches the obvious failures (e.g., 80's Espresso with 1.1 g yield
  and ~0.3 mL/s mean).
- **Moderate (yield arm)**: `finalWeightG / targetWeightG < CHOKED_YIELD_RATIO_MAX`
  (0.85). Catches narrowly-above-flow-threshold cases where the puck still
  failed (e.g., 25 g of a 36 g target, ~0.6 mL/s mean).

The yield arm requires both `targetWeightG > 0` and `finalWeightG > 0` —
imported shots without target metadata correctly stay silent.
`finalWeightG` works on either a real BLE scale or Decenza's `FlowScale`
virtual scale (dose-aware flow integration), so the arm fires headless too.

**Hard skips** (`skipped = true`, both arms suppressed):

- Beverage type is `filter`, `pourover`, `tea`, `steam`, or `cleaning`.
- `analysisFlags` contains `grind_check_skip`.
- Pressure data is empty (the arm-2 path early-returns).

### 2.3 Temperature unstable

The simplest of the five. `temperatureUnstable = true` when:

- `temperature` and `temperatureGoal` both have > 10 samples, AND
- `pourStart > 0` (a Pour / infus / Start phase marker was found — without
  it, `avgTempDeviation` would average from t=0 and pull in the preheat
  ramp), AND
- `reachedExtractionPhase(phases, duration)` is true: at least one phase
  marker with `frameNumber ≥ 1` exists `TEMP_MIN_EXTRACTION_SEC` (1.0 s)
  before the shot's last sample. Aborted shots that died during
  preinfusion-start would otherwise read the machine's preheat ramp as
  drift; the firmware sometimes records the 0→1 transition in the final
  ms before stop, so a marker-presence-only check is not enough — the
  phase has to have actually lasted, AND
- `hasIntentionalTempStepping(temperatureGoal)` is false (goal range ≤
  `TEMP_STEPPING_RANGE` = 5 °C — D-Flow 84 → 94 is intentional, ignore), AND
- `avgTempDeviation(temperature, temperatureGoal, pourStart, pourEnd) >
  TEMP_UNSTABLE_THRESHOLD` (2.0 °C).

`avgTempDeviation` is the average absolute deviation over the pour window
where the goal is non-zero.

The `pourStart > 0` and `reachedExtractionPhase` guards are applied at
all three call sites (`analyzeShot`, `saveShot`, `loadShotRecordStatic`)
so live, save-time, and recompute-on-load all converge on the same flag
value — important because `loadShotRecordStatic` writes drift back to the
DB (see §4) and any asymmetry would silently flip flags between sessions.

### 2.4 Skip first frame

`detectSkipFirstFrame` operates on phase markers only — no curves needed. Two
distinct branches inside one function, picked from the marker stream:

**FW-bug branch** — frame 0 was never observed before a non-zero frame:
returns `phase.time < 2.0`. The 2-second window matches the de1app Tcl
plugin's polling cadence (it can only catch this before t = 2 s), so we use
the same hard window for parity. This case requires a power-cycle to fix.

**Short-first-step branch** — frame 0 was observed but ended early:
returns `phase.time < cutoff` where:

```
cutoff = (firstFrameConfiguredSeconds > 0)
       ? min(2.0, 0.5 * firstFrameConfiguredSeconds)
       : 2.0
```

The configured-aware path avoids false positives on profiles whose first
frame is configured for 2 seconds — BLE notification jitter routinely lands
the frame-1 marker a few hundred ms early, and a 1.87 s actual on a 2 s
configured frame should not flag.

`expectedFrameCount` is honored when known: values < 2 suppress detection
(no second frame to skip to), and out-of-range frame numbers are skipped as
malformed.

`firstFrameConfiguredSeconds` is fed in by callers from `ProfileFrameInfo`
(parsed from the stored profile JSON via `profileFrameInfoFromJson`).

### 2.5 Pour truncated (puck failed)

`detectPourTruncated` returns true when peak pressure inside the pour window
stays below `PRESSURE_FLOOR_BAR` (2.5). It catches the failure mode where
conductance saturates at its clamp, `dC/dt` is flat, and flow tracks the
preinfusion goal perfectly — every other detector goes silent or fires the
wrong diagnosis. Skipped for filter / pourover / tea / steam / cleaning
beverages where low pressure is expected.

**Suppression cascade.** When this detector fires, the save block, the
load-time recompute, and `analyzeShot` all force `channelingDetected`
/ `temperatureUnstable` / `grindIssueDetected` to false. See §1 for the
rationale; see §4 for where it's enforced.

**Population the badge catches.** A puck-failure shot can come from any of:
grind way too coarse, distribution failure (massive channel), no/loose
puck or missing basket, severe underdose, profile misconfigured (high
flow goal with no pressure cap), or an early abort. The user can't
discriminate among these from the curve, so the verdict text leads with
the meta-action ("Don't tune off this shot — peak pressure never built,
so the other quality signals are unreliable") rather than naming a
specific fix.

---

## 3. Shot Summary dialog

The "Shot Summary" chip at the end of the badge row opens
`qml/components/ShotAnalysisDialog.qml` — a non-AI, non-modal-blocking
analysis pane that surfaces a list of observations plus a single verdict
line. The text is computed entirely in C++ from the captured curves; the
QML side is a thin display layer.

### Pipeline

There are two consumer paths that share a single detector pass:

- **In-app dialog path** (returns prose only):
  `ShotAnalysisDialog` (visible) →
  `MainController.shotHistory.generateShotSummary(shotData)` (Q_INVOKABLE on
  `ShotHistoryStorage`) →
  `ShotAnalysis::generateSummary(...)` *(thin wrapper that returns
  `analyzeShot(...).lines`)* →
  `QVariantList` of `{ text, type }` lines →
  `Repeater` in the dialog with a colored dot per line.
- **MCP path** (returns prose + structured detectors):
  `convertShotRecord` → `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot(...)` →
  `AnalysisResult { lines, detectors }` → emitted as `summaryLines` plus a
  nested `detectorResults` JSON object on every shot record served by
  `shots_get_detail` / `shots_compare`.

Both paths run the same `analyzeShot` body. The dialog discards `detectors`;
MCP serializes the full struct. Existing callers that only want the prose
lines (the Q_INVOKABLE bridge above, the AI advisor prompt builder) keep
working unchanged through the `generateSummary` wrapper.

`generateShotSummary` is the bridge that converts the QML `shotData` map
into the typed vectors `analyzeShot` expects (pressure, flow, weight,
temperature + goals, conductance derivative, phases, beverage type, profile
JSON for first-frame seconds, yield override + final weight for the choked-
puck yield arm). Empty / missing fields are tolerated where the underlying
detector tolerates them.

### Line types and rendering

Each line carries a `type`:

| Type          | Dot color                     | Used for                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `good`        | success (green)               | "Puck stable", happy-path observations     |
| `caution`     | warning (orange)              | flow drift, temp drift, grind direction    |
| `warning`     | error (red)                   | sustained channeling, choked puck, frame skip, pour truncated |
| `observation` | text-secondary (neutral grey) | preinfusion drip mass / duration           |
| `verdict`     | no dot, larger font           | always exactly one, last in the list       |

The dialog renders the verdict in subtitle font with no dot to set it apart
from the observation lines.

### Observations emitted

`analyzeShot` computes `pourTruncated` first; when it fires, the
channeling / flow-trend / temperature / grind blocks below all skip
emission entirely. The list collapses to a single warning + the
puck-failed verdict. Order otherwise follows `analyzeShot`
top-to-bottom:

1. **Channeling status** — uses the same `buildChannelingWindows` +
   `detectChannelingFromDerivative` path as the badge. Emits **Sustained**
   ("warning"), **Transient** ("caution") with the spike timestamp, or a
   "Puck stable" ("good") line. Skipped for filter / pourover / tea /
   steam / cleaning beverages, turbo shots, profiles with the
   `channeling_expected` analysis flag, **and when `pourTruncated`
   fires**.
2. **Flow trend** — compares mean flow in the first 30% of the pour
   against the last 30%. ±0.5 mL/s thresholds emit "Flow rose … (puck
   erosion)" or "Flow dropped … (fines migration or clogging)" as
   "caution". Suppressed for profiles with the `flow_trend_ok` analysis
   flag (Cremina lever and similar where declining/rising flow is by
   design), **and when `pourTruncated` fires**.
3. **Preinfusion drip** — when preinfusion lasted > 1 s and at least 0.5 g
   landed during it, emits "Preinfusion: Xg in Ys" as an "observation".
   Not gated on `pourTruncated` — drip mass is a fact, not a diagnosis.
4. **Temperature stability** — when `hasIntentionalTempStepping` is false
   and `avgTempDeviation` exceeds 2 °C, emits "Temperature drifted X °C
   from goal on average" as "caution". **Suppressed when `pourTruncated`
   fires.**
5. **Grind direction** — uses the same `analyzeFlowVsGoal` path as the
   badge. Emits one of: "Pour produced near-zero flow while pressure
   held — puck choked" ("warning") when `chokedPuck` fires, "Flow
   averaged X mL/s below target — grind may be too fine" ("caution"),
   "Flow averaged X mL/s above target — grind may be too coarse"
   ("caution"), or nothing when within tolerance. **Suppressed when
   `pourTruncated` fires.**
6. **Pour truncated** — `detectPourTruncated`. Emits "Pour never
   pressurized (peak X bar) — puck offered no resistance. Likely
   causes: grind way too coarse, distribution failure, no/loose puck,
   severe underdose, or profile without a pressure cap." as "warning"
   when peak pressure stayed under 2.5 bar. The actual peak value is
   substituted into the line.
7. **Skip first frame** — `detectSkipFirstFrame`. Emits "First profile
   step skipped — likely a DE1 firmware bug…" as "warning". Not gated
   on `pourTruncated` — frame-skip is orthogonal to puck integrity.

### Verdict precedence

Exactly one verdict line is appended to every summary. The cascade picks
the first match (more specific failures take precedence over generic
puck-integrity advice):

1. **Pour truncated** → "Don't tune off this shot — peak pressure never
   built, so the other quality signals (channeling, grind direction,
   temp) are unreliable. Check prep (dose, distribution, basket, grind)
   and pull another." Dominates over channeling / grind / temperature
   since the puck never built any resistance worth analyzing; leads with
   the meta-action because the shot has no useful tuning signal.
2. **Skip first frame** → "First profile step was skipped — power-cycle…"
   Pre-empts choked-puck because a frame-skip can synthesise extraction
   dynamics that resemble a choke; fix the machine first, then re-evaluate.
3. **Choked puck** → "Puck choked — grind way too fine. Coarsen
   significantly." Pre-empts the generic "Puck integrity issue" verdict
   below.
4. **Has any "warning"** → "Puck integrity issue — improve distribution."
   When a directional grind signal is present alongside, it appends
   "Grind is running fine — try coarser." or "Grind is running coarse —
   try finer." as a modifier (since channeling alone doesn't tell you
   which direction grind is off).
5. **Has any "caution"** → If grind data is directional (`|delta| >
   FLOW_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD`), names the direction ("Grind appears too
   fine — try coarser." / "…too coarse — try finer.") regardless of any
   other cautions also present. Otherwise: "Decent shot with minor
   issues to watch." (The in-source comment phrases this as "if the
   only caution is a grind direction," but the implementation does not
   actually check for uniqueness — a directional grind delta wins over
   a co-occurring temperature or flow-trend caution.)
6. **Otherwise** → "Clean shot. Puck held well."

### Triggering and lifecycle

The dialog is instantiated declaratively inside `ShotDetailPage.qml` and
`PostShotReviewPage.qml`. The `Shot Summary` chip in `QualityBadges.qml`
emits `summaryRequested()` on tap, which the host page handles by calling
`open()` on its `ShotAnalysisDialog` instance. Analysis lines are
recomputed each time the dialog becomes visible (the
`MainController.shotHistory.generateShotSummary(shotData)` binding only
fires while `analysisDialog.visible` is true), so detector improvements
take effect on summary text the same way they do on badges — no save-time
freeze. There is no DB persistence for summary lines; they're regenerated
on demand.

### AI advisor consumes the same line list (PR #930)

The in-app AI advisor's prompt is built by `ShotSummarizer::buildUserPrompt`,
which ships the same `analyzeShot` line list under a `## Detector
Observations` section with a preamble framing the lines as detector
evidence (severity tags `[warning]` / `[caution]` / `[good]` /
`[observation]`). The `verdict` line is filtered out so the AI reasons
from the same observations the verdict was built from rather than
anchoring on the dialog's pre-cooked conclusion. The suppression cascade
is enforced in exactly one place — `analyzeShot` — so the badge UI,
the dialog, and the AI advisor cannot drift.

### External MCP agents see structured detectors (PR #933, resolved Issue #931)

`ShotHistoryStorage::convertShotRecord` runs `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot`
once per shot conversion and emits both `summaryLines` (the prose list
the dialog renders) and a nested `detectorResults` JSON object on every
shot record served by `shots_get_detail` / `shots_compare`. The
`detectorResults` shape is documented in
[`docs/CLAUDE_MD/MCP_SERVER.md`](CLAUDE_MD/MCP_SERVER.md) under "Shot
Detector Outputs" and mirrors the `ShotAnalysis::DetectorResults` C++
struct: channeling severity, flow trend, grind direction (with
`chokedPuck` / `yieldOvershoot` flags), pour-truncated + peak pressure,
skip-first-frame, and a stable enum-like `verdictCategory` string.

The struct is a *superset* of what `summaryLines` renders — clean
signals (`flowTrend = "stable"`, `grindDirection = "onTarget"`) appear
in `detectorResults` but produce no prose line. The verdict prose is
intentionally NOT exposed as a separate field; external agents read
`verdictCategory` and compose their own framing.

The five legacy badge booleans (`channelingDetected`, etc.) on
`convertShotRecord` remain available for backwards compatibility.

---

## 4. Persistence semantics

### Save-time: stored columns

The `shots` table has five flag columns: `pour_truncated_detected`,
`channeling_detected`, `temperature_unstable`, `grind_issue_detected`,
`skip_first_frame_detected`. At shot save (or import), the badges are
computed once from the captured curves and written into these columns
alongside the rest of the shot record.

`pour_truncated_detected` is computed **first** at save time. When it's
true, `channeling_detected` / `temperature_unstable` / `grind_issue_detected`
are forced to false (their gates check `!data.pourTruncatedDetected`).
`skip_first_frame_detected` is not gated.

### Load-time: always recompute (PR #893, extended for the 5th badge in PR #922)

`ShotHistoryStorage::loadShotRecordStatic` reads the stored columns, then
**unconditionally recomputes all five badges** from the loaded curve data
before returning. The same suppression cascade runs here: `pourTruncated`
is computed first and the channeling / temp / grind blocks are gated on
`!record.pourTruncatedDetected`. This means the in-memory `ShotRecord`
always reflects the current detector logic and the cascade is consistent
between save and load. The recompute block lives in `loadShotRecordStatic`
(around the comment "Always recompute every quality badge from the loaded
curve data").

The recompute uses on-the-fly derived curves for legacy shots that lack them:
`computeDerivedCurves` fills `conductanceDerivative` from `pressure`/`flow`
when the shot predates migration 10 (the `conductance` column).

### Lazy persist on view (PR #893)

When a shot is opened in `ShotDetailPage` or `PostShotReviewPage`, QML calls
`MainController.shotHistory.requestReanalyzeBadges(id)`. That method runs on
the DB worker thread and recomputes the five flags. If at least one flag
differs from the stored value, it issues an `UPDATE` *and* emits
`shotBadgesUpdated(shotId, channeling, tempUnstable, grindIssue,
skipFirstFrame, pourTruncated)` (six args; the puck-failure flag was added
in PR #922) so the UI can refresh without a full reload. If every flag
already matches the stored value, the worker exits silently — no `UPDATE`,
no signal, no UI refresh.

The wiring lives at `qml/pages/ShotDetailPage.qml` (in `onShotReady`) and
`qml/pages/PostShotReviewPage.qml`. The visualizer-update reload path
suppresses it (badges didn't change, and the visualizer flow already
triggers a second `onShotReady`).

### Residual gap (Issue #894)

`requestShotsFiltered` → `buildFilterQuery()` (around
`shothistorystorage.cpp:1463-1474`) builds badge filters against the **stored
columns**, not the recomputed values. The MCP `shots_list` tool reads the
same stored columns. So a shot whose recomputed badges no longer match the
stored values is consistent in the detail view (after one open, lazy persist
catches up) but inconsistent in:

- The history-list filter chips ("Show only channeling shots") for shots not
  yet viewed under the current detectors.
- `shots_list` MCP responses for the same.

Tracked in #894. Options on the table: a one-shot bulk resweep (option 1),
adding a manual "Re-analyze all shots" button (option 2), or both (hybrid).
Held until the detectors stabilize — the next round of fixes would just
require another sweep.

---

## 5. Code map

### Detector logic

- `src/ai/shotanalysis.{h,cpp}` — all five detectors, `analyzeFlowVsGoal`,
  `buildChannelingWindows`, `detectChannelingFromDerivative`,
  `detectGrindIssue`, `detectSkipFirstFrame`, `detectPourTruncated`,
  `hasIntentionalTempStepping`, `avgTempDeviation`, `shouldSkipChannelingCheck`,
  `analyzeShot` (returns `AnalysisResult { lines, detectors }` — feeds
  the Shot Summary dialog and MCP; see §3), `generateSummary` (thin
  wrapper returning `analyzeShot(...).lines`), `DetectorResults` /
  `AnalysisResult` structs, all tuning constants.

### Persistence

- `src/history/shothistorystorage.{h,cpp}`:
  - `loadShotRecordStatic` — load + recompute block (the "always recompute
    every quality badge" comment marks the section).
  - `requestReanalyzeBadges` — lazy-persist worker.
  - `requestShotsFiltered` + `buildFilterQuery` — history-list filter that
    reads the stored columns.
  - `generateShotSummary` — Q_INVOKABLE bridge that converts a QML
    `shotData` map into the typed inputs for `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot`
    and returns the prose `lines`.
  - `convertShotRecord` — runs `analyzeShot` once per shot conversion;
    emits `summaryLines` (prose) and a nested `detectorResults` JSON
    object on every shot record served by MCP / web endpoints.
  - DB migrations for the five flag columns (10–13; migration 13 adds
    `pour_truncated_detected`).
  - `computeDerivedCurves` — fills conductance / dC/dt for legacy shots that
    predate migration 10.
  - `profileFrameInfoFromJson` — extracts `frameCount` and
    `firstFrameSeconds` for `detectSkipFirstFrame` and the summary path.

### Profile-level analysis flags

- `src/profile/profileknowledge.{h,cpp}` — KB entries that carry per-profile
  `analysisFlags` (`channeling_expected`, `grind_check_skip`,
  `bloom_self_heal`, etc.).
- `ShotSummarizer::getAnalysisFlags(profileKbId)` is the canonical lookup
  used by both detector callers and `loadShotRecordStatic`.

### UI

- `qml/components/QualityBadges.qml` — chip rendering. One chip per active
  flag; when none active, a single "Clean extraction" chip; always a
  trailing "Shot Summary" chip that emits `summaryRequested()`.
- `qml/components/ShotAnalysisDialog.qml` — Shot Summary dialog. Calls
  `MainController.shotHistory.generateShotSummary(shotData)` while
  visible and renders the resulting `{ text, type }` lines.
- `qml/pages/ShotDetailPage.qml` and `qml/pages/PostShotReviewPage.qml` —
  consume `shotData.channelingDetected` / `temperatureUnstable` /
  `grindIssueDetected` / `skipFirstFrameDetected` / `pourTruncatedDetected`,
  listen for `shotBadgesUpdated`, call `requestReanalyzeBadges` on load,
  host the `ShotAnalysisDialog` instance and wire `summaryRequested` to
  `open()`.
- `qml/pages/ShotHistoryPage.qml` — filter chips that consume the stored
  columns.

### MCP

- `src/mcp/mcptools_shots.cpp` — `shots_list` reads stored columns;
  `shots_get_detail` runs through `loadShotRecordStatic` and so reflects
  recomputed badges.

## 6. Regression corpus

`tools/shot_eval/` is a CLI harness that runs the live detectors against a
curated corpus of shot fixtures and prints (or validates) the verdicts.

- **Fixtures**: `tests/data/shots/*.json` — curated real shots covering
  lever-clean (Cremina, E61, Damian LRv3, classic Italian), lever / E61
  failure modes (80's Espresso choked moderate / puck failure, classic
  Italian fast, Londinium gusher, blooming aborted / choker, puck-failure
  short gusher), grind-fine (Malabar D-Flow), and Adaptive v2 cases (Gagne).
- **Manifest**: `tests/data/shots/manifest.json` — golden verdicts per
  fixture.
- **CTest target**: `shot_corpus_regression` (declared in
  `tests/CMakeLists.txt`) runs `shot_eval --validate manifest.json`. Linux
  CI catches detector regressions before merge.

To add a fixture:

1. Drop the captured shot JSON in `tests/data/shots/`.
2. Add an entry to `manifest.json` with the expected badge / verdict.
3. Run `shot_eval --validate` locally (or via the ctest target) to confirm.
4. Commit both files together so the manifest documents the new golden.

- PR #930 / Issue #921 — `ShotSummarizer` (AI advisor prompt path) now
  shares the suppression cascade. Detector orchestration delegates to
  `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot`, the same call `ShotHistoryStorage::generateShotSummary`
  makes for the dialog. The prompt's `## Detector Observations` section
  emits `analyzeShot`'s line list verbatim with severity tags
  (`[warning]` / `[caution]` / `[good]` / `[observation]`) under a preamble
  framing the lines as detector evidence. The `verdict` line is filtered
  out before emission so the AI reasons from the same observations the
  user sees in the dialog without anchoring on the dialog's prescriptive
  conclusion. Per-phase `PhaseSummary::temperatureUnstable` markers are
  gated on the same `reachedExtractionPhase` + `pourTruncatedDetected`
  cascade the aggregate temp detector uses. Cleanup: dropped dead
  `ShotSummary` fields (`channelingDetected`, `temperatureUnstable`,
  `timeToFirstDrip`, `preinfusionDuration`, `mainExtractionDuration`)
  and the wrapper helpers (`detectChannelingInPhases`,
  `calculateTemperatureStability`) they fed.
- PR #933 / Issue #931 — `convertShotRecord` runs `analyzeShot` once
  per shot conversion and emits both `summaryLines` (prose) and
  structured `detectorResults` JSON on `shots_get_detail` /
  `shots_compare`. Refactored `generateSummary` into a thin wrapper
  over the new `analyzeShot()` entry point that returns
  `AnalysisResult { lines, detectors }`. The `DetectorResults` struct
  is the source for prose; sharing one detector pass keeps both
  outputs in lockstep. Verdict prose is intentionally NOT exposed —
  agents read the stable `verdictCategory` enum instead. Field
